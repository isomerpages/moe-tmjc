<p>Life is an adventure, replete with unexpected challenges and discoveries
about ourselves and the world around us.
<br>
<br>Recently, I embarked on the adventure of a lifetime - I leapt from a plane,
safely strapped to an instructor (of course). The experience was a whirlwind
of intense emotions, with the nagging 'what if' question constantly hanging
at the back of my mind.
<br>
<br>My instructor's expertise made all the difference. His patient explanations,
constant safety checks, and continual reassurance were crucial in helping
me overcome my fears and embrace this exhilarating experience.
<br>
<br>This guidance from an expert mirrors what our students need as they navigate
their own adventures of transitioning into adulthood, learning to lead
themselves and others. Whether grappling with complex academic concepts
or managing team dynamics in co-curricular activities, new experiences
can be both bewildering and challenging.
<br>
<br>Our teachers, in their various roles as subject tutors, civics tutors,
and CCA advisors, serve as mentors to our students. Unlike my skydiving
instructor, they don't simply tell students what to do. Instead, they offer
advice, present options, and suggest possible directions, empowering students
to navigate their own paths.
<br>
<br>As a college, we collaborate with parents, alumni, the community, and
industry partners to provide opportunities for students to understand and
appreciate the future landscape.
<br>
<br>Given the trajectory of global events, we anticipate 2025 to be a tumultuous
year. However, if we approach it with the mindset of adventurers-at-heart,
I'm confident it will be a year rich with learning opportunities.
<br>
<br>Extracting from our college anthem:
<br><em>The world is every changing <br>No challenge is too big,<br>With courage and resilience,<br>With honour we’ll succeed.</em>
<br>
<br>Mr Sin Kim Ho
<br>Principal</p>
