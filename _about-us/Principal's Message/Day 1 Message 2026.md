<p>I believe in the transformative power of stepping beyond our comfort zones.
Whether it's mastering an unfamiliar skill, breaking free from routine
habits, or embarking on an unexpected adventure, it is precisely in these
moments of gentle discomfort that we discover our greatest capacity for
growth.
<br>
<br>We stand at a pivotal moment in human history. The rapid development of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping not just our technological landscape,
but the very foundations of how we work, learn, and connect. As educators,
we cannot afford to be passive observers of this transformation. This year,
I have challenged myself to delve deeper into understanding AI through
an educator's lens — exploring how AI works, what this teaches us about
human reasoning, and how we can harness its potential to enhance rather
than replace meaningful learning.
<br>
<br>My line of inquiry has guided by these questions:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What are the irreplaceable human qualities we must nurture in our students?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we design educational experiences in school that prepare young
minds for a world we can barely imagine?</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I may never find definitive answers, particularly given the unabating
pace of advancement. Yet making sense of these uncertainties is not just
beneficial — it is essential.
<br>
<br>One truth has emerged clearly: the irreplaceable value of authentic human
connection. While AI may excel at processing information and solving complex
problems, it cannot replicate the depth of empathy, creativity, and genuine
relationship-building that defines our humanity. These are the qualities
we must cultivate with renewed vigour in our students, whether in the form
of ‘soft skills’ or 21CC.
<br>
<br>As the college embark on our re-envisioning journey for the years ahead,
I invite each member of our community to awaken the adventurer within.
Together, let us approach this era of unprecedented change not with trepidation,
but with curiosity, courage, and an unwavering commitment to preparing
our students for a future filled with both promises and possibilities.
<br>
<br>The journey ahead may be uncertain, but it is one we will navigate together,
learning and growing every step of the way.
<br>
<br>Let’s once again wake up that little adventurer within each of us.
<br>
