When we started 2021, we were all hopeful that it would be a better year after that tumultuous 2020 of fighting COVID-19. Alas, it was not to be as we were bombarded with the more vicious strains of the virus, first Delta and then Omicron.  
  
Still, we were not defeated and I would even say, we more than survived 2021 because as a college, we held onto our 2021 theme of “Be Better Together”. Indeed, from the 2020 of “Be Better”, we moved into “Be Better Together” in 2021 because we know we can do much more when we allow ourselves to see beyond the strength of just one individual working to improve oneself.  
  
Now that we are into 2022, we further extend our theme and we declare – “Be Better Together, United as ONE”. This extension allows us to not just tap on each other for strength and support but to also realise the potential of the WHOLE.  
  
My dear students, are you ready for 2022?

### Lets be the One

In TMJC, we always start with looking at what we can do. We believe that even when we are but one, even if we think we are a mere tiny one, we have the strength to make a difference. There is a lovely poem that aptly summarises the importance and the power of the One.
