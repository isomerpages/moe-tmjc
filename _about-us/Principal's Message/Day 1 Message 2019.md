A school is only a school when we hear the laughter and the chatter of students and staff. While Tampines Meridian Junior College (TMJC) technically started on 1 Jan 2019, it was only on our first day of school, 7 Jan 2019 that the real life of TMJC began. So to our pioneer batch of TMJC students, welcome to the start of our first new school year!

On our first morning as a college, we witnessed the lowering of both our parent colleges’ flags. It was to be a reminder to all of us, in TMJC that we carry with us the heritage and culture of our two parent colleges and the hoisting of our new college flag is symbolic of the mission ahead of us as pioneers of our new school – Tampines Meridian Junior College.

We also had our first staff-student soccer match the same morning. I told the students that as pioneers, they get to set traditions. If they should think that a staff-student game to start the school year would be a good idea, we could always make it the TMJC tradition. Indeed, as a new college, we get to do many new things and establish the college the way we want her to be. I believe that our college can only be built by the ME in all of us. And it is from the ME that the WE is built. 

At the start of every year, I would choose a story to illustrate our focus for the year. This is the story for this year – a story for all of us, staff and students, as pioneers of TMJC.

(edited from [https://livelifehappy.com/live-life-happy-stories/](https://livelifehappy.com/live-life-happy-stories/))

A story was told of an elderly carpenter who was ready to retire and he told his employer of his plans to leave the house building business and live a more leisurely life with his wife, enjoying the company of his extended family. He would miss the pay check, but he was really tired and needed to retire, and they could get by.

The employer was sorry to see his good worker go and asked if he could build just one more house as a personal favour. The carpenter said yes, but in time it was easy to see that his heart was not in his work. He resorted to shoddy workmanship and used inferior materials. It was an unfortunate way to end his career.

When the carpenter finished his work, his employer came to inspect the house. Then he handed the front-door key to the carpenter and said, “This is your house… my gift to you.”

You can imagine the shock on the carpenter’s face. What a shame! If he had only known he was building his own house, he would have done it all so differently.

But isn’t it so with us too? We build our lives, a day at a time, often putting less than our best into the building. Then, with a shock, we realise we have to live in the house we have built. If we could do it over, we would do it much differently, won’t we?  

I share this story first for us as a college. We are building a new college. We have the privilege and the opportunity to do it right, right from the start. May this story be a reminder to give our best because we are building this college for ourselves. Secondly, to my dear students, you are in the process of building your own life. You can decide now how your year is going to be. You are the carpenter, and every day you hammer a nail, place a board, or erect a wall. Someone once said, “Life is a do-it-yourself project.” Your attitude, and the choices you make today, help build the “house” you will live in tomorrow. Therefore, with the start of this brand new year, commit to building wisely.

And to the potential students reading this website in search of a place to go after your GCE O levels, if you are excited about pioneering work, enjoy the challenge of working to build up a new place, establishing traditions for the future generations, TMJC is the place for you! And our promise to you would be that we will do our utmost to support you in your journey of finding meaning and purpose, learning and growing as a young person.

TMJC is in the building business - we build lives and hearts here.
