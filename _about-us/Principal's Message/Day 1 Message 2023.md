I am privileged and honoured to join the TMJC family, in taking over the helm of the college from Ms Pamela Yoong in 2023. She has led the college well in ensuring a smooth merger between two junior colleges with rich histories, and we thank her for the strong stewardship.  I wish Ms Yoong all the best in her new role.

The JC years also mark the onset of adulthood for our students.  Physiologically, this period coincides with the rapid prefrontal cortex development of the adolescent brain (that lasts into their mid-20s), psychologically manifesting in rationality playing an increasingly dominant role in their decision-making process over emotionality.  At TMJC, we believe this is the window of golden opportunity to guide our young adults in enabling them to understand and make sense of the world around them, and frame their worldview into adulthood.  That is an intent of the JC experience.   

The staff members are committed to facilitate the realisation of these outcomes by TMJCians.  They are the mentors and role models who provide the environment that students can mature and thrive.  I will work closely with the dedicated TMJC teachers and staff members to make their JC years a deep and meaningful learning experience for our young adults.  
  
Integral to making the learning real and relevant, TMJC will also continue to partner our valued alumni, community and industry to enrich the learning for our students.  TMJC is fortunate to be situated in a vibrant part of Singapore with a world-class air transport hub, thriving industries and nature parks that we can harness to bring the learning out of the classroom.  We shall forge the partnerships with stakeholders to bring about those possibilities.  
  
For our students, 2023 also marks the year that Singapore and the world emerges fully from the pandemic.  We hope to progressively resume the college activities that we could not have carried out in the past 3 years, and I look forward to all your whole-hearted participation and adopt a spirited-learning to create a memorable JC experience for you.  
  
With our hearts and minds inspired, together as we grow!

  
Mr Sin Kim Ho  
Principal
