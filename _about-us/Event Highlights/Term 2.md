### 2022 Pre-University Seminar

A group of 20 students represented Tampines Meridian Junior College at this year’s Pre-University Seminar from 31 May to 3 June 2022.  An important event for all Pre-University institutions, this year’s Pre-University Seminar theme is _‘Service: Forging the Singapore Story’_. The theme was inspired by Prime Minister (PM) Lee’s National Day Rally 2021 speech, where he inspired Singaporeans to consider ways in which everyone could play a part in service to the nation.

Our students were given the chance to learn from the rich experiences of various guest speakers and were able to keenly appreciate how individuals from different walks of life have contributed to Singapore. The empathy cultivated through active listening and engagement inspired our students to envision and imagine the future of Singapore, one in which they could serve the community and the nation.

At the Opening Ceremony, the Guest of Honour was Minister for Education Mr. Chan Chun Sing. Our students were challenged to be curious, connected, and confident, so as to take on the mantle to lead Singapore to SG100. In particular, under the College’s allocated subtheme of ‘Resilience’, our students embarked on learning journeys to Keppel Harbour and the Singapore Maritime Gallery to learn about the resilience of past generations.

Inspired to play an active role in Singapore’s future, our students shared how they could contribute to creating a resilient Singapore.  Over the course of the Seminar, our students were empowered to work on their respective projects. This eventually culminated in an exhibition, where our students confidently presented their project deliverables to guests.

The Closing Ceremony was graced by Mr. Alvin Tan, Minister of State for the Ministry of Culture, Community, and Youth, and the Ministry of Trade and Industry, and our TMJC students were inspired to play their part in shaping the Singapore Story.

### SBS Transit CARES Kindness 2022
  
On 27th May 2022, in conjunction with SBS Transit CARES Kindness Month, students from the Interact Club designed a postcard to give to members of the public to promote kindness towards bus captains. The students also prepared an appreciation board, care packs and set up a welfare corner for the staff working at Tampines Bus Interchange and the Tampines Downtown Line MRT Station. The students were glad to have the opportunity to interact and personally express their gratitude to the bus captains.  
  
The TMJC family would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to all those who have been tirelessly working to ensure that our daily commute around Singapore is smooth and safe.

### JC1 SG Perspectives - Ministry of Foreign Affairs Engagement Session
  
On 20 May, JC1 students had the unique opportunity to engage Singapore’s former Ambassador to Qatar, His Excellency Mr Wong Kwok Pun, in dialogue. The Ambassador’s engagement session was part of the ‘SG Perspectives’ Programme which seeks to broaden students’ perspectives of Singapore’s foreign policy and how it affects them. The session took place in the library with our Citizenship Education Ambassadors as live audience, while the rest of the JC1 cohort tuned in via broadcast at the various venues in college.  
  
Through Ambassador Wong’s sharing, students were sensitised to the key principles of Singapore’s foreign policy and her persistent vulnerabilities as a small country. They also learnt about how foreign policy impacts their lives. Finally, our students engaged him in dialogue on contemporary issues that impact Singapore—such as the Ukrainian crisis and US withdrawal from Afghanistan.  
  
The college would like to thank Ambassador Wong for this most enriching session. The college would also like to thank the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education (Character & Citizenship Education Branch) for co-organising this dialogue for the benefit of our students.

### Arts and Humanities Week

Led by a JC2 Student Organising Committee, both JC1 and JC2 students came together to curate a spectrum of projects to showcase, bringing together skills and content learnt from various Arts and Humanities subjects. There were skits, exhibitions, crafts, poetry recitations, and games that allowed those who attended to learn something new and get a taste of how the arts and humanities can be relevant to society.

The Week also featured a Speaker Series, specifically for the Arts and Humanities students. On Wednesday, 11th May, NUS History Professor, Ian Gordon, shared his knowledge about how History and Art, in the form of comics, can work together. And on Friday, 13th May, Jamie Lee and Mark Tan from the Madhatter Project demonstrated how History and Literature can be weaved together in the performing arts as a platform to reach out to people and share ideas on important issues.

The week ended with a Finale Concert displaying some of the very best showcase projects, a Kahoot Quiz and a video montage capturing the many engaging moments of the week. The Arts and Humanities students will indeed continue to make waves here in TMJC.

### International Friendship Day x EU @ Your School 2022
  
From 18 April – 9 May, TMJC commemorated International Friendship Day to imbue in students an appreciation for diversity and cross-cultural awareness. The theme was ‘Singapore in Asia (and Beyond)’ and the commemoration focused on deepening students’ understanding of the friendships nurtured in the ASEAN region, one of the world’s fastest-growing economic blocs. Our international students created a series of engaging multimedia presentations that featured the unique sights, sounds and stories of Southeast Asia. To increase their cultural sensitivity via hands-on learning, students participated in culturally significant games and pastimes such as shadow puppetry during their Character & Citizenship lessons. Students also learnt about the opportunities present in ASEAN to combat climate change together, a matter of grave importance given that the region is one of the world’s most vulnerable to climate change.  
  
To gain exposure to the world beyond ASEAN, students had the invaluable opportunity to hear from the Danish Ambassador to Singapore, Ms Sandra Jensen Landi. Her visit is part of the “EU @ Your School Project” that seeks to broaden global perspectives through an introduction to the rich and diverse cultures of Europe. Students learnt about the EU and many interesting aspects of Danish culture. Our newly minted Citizenship Education Ambassadors also engaged her in dialogue on contemporary issues that impact Denmark, ASEAN and the World.  
  
The commemoration came to a close with a special invitation from the Royal Danish Embassy for one of our Citizenship Education Ambassadors to join the Deputy Head of Mission, Ms Birgit Dohmann Chang, in a tree-planting activity on 9 May to commemorate Europe Day 2022. The event demonstrated Singapore-EU solidarity with Ukraine and symbolised hope for a brighter future through the joint commitment between the EU and Singapore to combat climate change.  
  
The College would like to thank the Royal Danish Embassy for enriching our students in myriad ways!
