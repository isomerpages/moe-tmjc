### TM Run 2022

On the 10th of March 2022, TMJC held our TM Run. This year, it was organised with the same format as 2021 but with the fresh inclusion of fringe activities and a creative cheer competition which encouraged the innovative use of banners, clappers, and pompoms initiated by the students. All the activities were organised with adherence to safe management measures and were planned in conjunction with our TMJC Student Councillors, who demonstrated a genuine heart to lead and serve the College.  
  
In preparation for TM Run, student competitors had been training diligently during and outside of PE lessons, and fellow classmates rallied their support by training alongside them as a form of camaraderie. In light of the logistical needs of the event that had to prioritise safety and adherence to safe distancing measures, students and staff readily volunteered to support as first aiders, ushers, road marshals, registration and transition zone referees, and helpers.  
  
Our students demonstrated their passion and commitment to the College as everyone played a vital role on that day. The TM Run competitors ran earnestly as they represented their CG, the spectators presented and utilised their handcrafted props to cheer their friends on and contributed to House points by participating actively in the fringe activities. Albeit the unfavourable weather conditions that brought the race to a premature end, the unforeseen circumstance was incapable of dampening our spirits and instead strengthened our College Spirit as a whole.  
  
Indeed, TM Run is a testament to our College’s ability to improve and shine through adversity as we strive “To Be Better Together, United as One!”
