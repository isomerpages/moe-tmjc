### TM Run 2022

On the 10th of March 2022, TMJC held our TM Run. This year, it was organised with the same format as 2021 but with the fresh inclusion of fringe activities and a creative cheer competition which encouraged the innovative use of banners, clappers, and pompoms initiated by the students. All the activities were organised with adherence to safe management measures and were planned in conjunction with our TMJC Student Councillors, who demonstrated a genuine heart to lead and serve the College.  
  
In preparation for TM Run, student competitors had been training diligently during and outside of PE lessons, and fellow classmates rallied their support by training alongside them as a form of camaraderie. In light of the logistical needs of the event that had to prioritise safety and adherence to safe distancing measures, students and staff readily volunteered to support as first aiders, ushers, road marshals, registration and transition zone referees, and helpers.  
  
Our students demonstrated their passion and commitment to the College as everyone played a vital role on that day. The TM Run competitors ran earnestly as they represented their CG, the spectators presented and utilised their handcrafted props to cheer their friends on and contributed to House points by participating actively in the fringe activities. Albeit the unfavourable weather conditions that brought the race to a premature end, the unforeseen circumstance was incapable of dampening our spirits and instead strengthened our College Spirit as a whole.  
  
Indeed, TM Run is a testament to our College’s ability to improve and shine through adversity as we strive “To Be Better Together, United as One!”

### JC1 Gratitude in Action - Red Dyed Eggs Activity

On 4th March, the JC1 students and their Civics Tutors had a great time participating in the Gratitude in Action activity where the students had a hand in dyeing eggs red to pack them into gift bags.  

  
They also wrote thank you messages to their parents, to be included into the gift bags. The students presented the red eggs and some traditional cakes (kuehs) as a gift to their parents to show their gratitude at the start of their JC journey, to thank their parents for their care and support thus far.  
  
We hope that the day’s activity provided the students with a good opportunity to bond with their classmates and helped to bring the parents and their children closer together.

### TM Connects 2022

TM Connects, a community awareness event organised by the TMJC Values In Action Committee, was carried out virtually on 4 March 2022 from 2.30pm to 5pm through Zoom. The theme for TM Connects 2022 is “Opening Minds, Impacting Lives”.  

  
Through TM Connects, we hope students can gain awareness and have a better understanding of different community issues, explore areas of interest and choose the organisations that they would like to serve. Thereafter, we hope TMJC students can seek to bring about positive change to the community.  
  
We thank our partner organisations and students from selected JC2 CGs and CCA who have come forward and shared enthusiastically with our JC1 students about service learning via a virtual platform during the session!

### Total Defence Day 2022
  
TMJC commemorated Total Defence Day (TDD) from 15 February to 11 March 2022 under the theme “Together, We Keep Singapore Strong”. Introduced in 1984 to mark the day Singapore fell to Japanese troops in 1942, the annual TDD Commemoration exhorts every Singaporean to play their part to keep Singapore safe, secure and independent.  
  
Amid Singapore’s transition towards COVID resilience, the significance of the day becomes more pronounced. In light of this, during their Character & Citizenship Education lessons, students took perspective, discussed what Total Defence meant to them and learnt about the role they can play in Singapore’s national defence. The commemoration culminated in a mural display outside the General Office, a collaboration between the Citizenship Education Committee and the Art Unit. The Total Defence Mural functions as a daily visual reminder to all TMJC students on the importance of being united and adaptable in Singapore’s journey towards living with COVID.

### Badge Pinning Ceremony
  
On 28 February 2022, the College held our annual Badge Pinning Ceremony. The ceremony symbolises the journey taken together by the JC1s and JC2s as they forge ahead as one TMJC student body.  
  
During the ceremony, CG Chairpersons and Peer Support Leaders from each JC2 class presented the College collar pins to their JC1 juniors to welcome them to the TMJC family. The JC2 seniors were also given the opportunity to share words of advice on what is truly essential in creating a memorable and meaningful 2 years in TMJC. Having walked through the journey themselves, the JC2 seniors’ words of advice left a great impact on their juniors. The JC1s then proudly put on their College collar pins together, signifying the official start of their wonderful and exciting journey ahead in TMJC.

### Tembusu Tree-Planting Ceremony 2022
  
On 22nd February 2022, TMJC held our 3rd Tree-Planting Ceremony. It represents a new beginning for the Class of 2021 as they graduate from College, whilst leaving fond memories deeply etched to the grounds of the College.  
This ceremony was led by Our School Leaders, Year Heads, together with student representatives from the 3rd Tampines Meridian Student Council:  Ms Joanne Lin Min Hui (20S303 / President) and Mr Jves Tan (20S207 / Vice-President).  

  
The Tembusu Tree-Planting Ceremony is a tradition TMJC started in 2020, as it commemorates the shared experiences and achievements of each cohort of students. The Tembusu Tree is chosen as it is a large, evergreen tree that matures with stately beauty, and can provide shelter for all. It is highly robust and can grow in almost any type of soil, testifying to its resilience. Such attributes symbolise the values and character that the College hopes to imbue in TMJC students.

Through a live broadcast, our Principal, Ms Pamela Yoong, shared the achievements of the Class of 2021. With anticipations escalating, Civic Tutors then distributed the results to individual students.  
  
As they plan their next step, the College is here to support them in their journey ahead.  
  
Our heartiest congratulations to the Class of 2021 for your stellar results. As we celebrate together, we look out for one another!

### JC1 Orientation & CCA Recruitment 2022

On the 7th of February 2022, TMJC kicked off our JC1 Orientation, Voyage, to receive our 5th batch of students. As our JC1s begin their JC journey, Voyage hopes to take them beyond their academic pursuits and bond them together, ready to embrace challenges as a team. The image of a ship setting off on a journey, aims to evoke excitement and build teamwork amongst the JC1s. In this journey, all staff and students will unite as a family to overcome all obstacles.  
The first day saw a series of informative JC Curriculum Talk and a Dialogue with School Leaders and Academic Heads that allowed students the opportunity to get a better understanding of the academic demands and rigor of the various disciplines. Students also enthusiastically visited the subject booths to find out more about the different subjects offered in TMJC.

The subsequent days of Orientation shed light on the robust College Spirit and vibrant student experiences here in TMJC. Dynamic House walk-in dances that the OGLs had prepared for months to fervently receive our JC1s sparked off the Day 2 activities. A series of icebreakers and bonding games were curated to pave the way for new friendships. In addition, the OGLs took on the roles as College Tour Ambassadors and enthusiastically introduced our College venues and facilities to the JC1s.
