The Multi-Purpose Hall (MPH) serves as the canteen, the only one among JCs to be fully equipped with air conditioning. Offering a wide array of food choices, the stalls cater to different dietary preferences and provide diverse choices of food and drinks for our students.  
  
The MPH is equipped with screen projectors and digital announcement boards, to update students on upcoming College events and administrative matters. Events such as JC1 Orientation and Farewell Assembly are sometimes held in the MPH with live broadcasts from various venues. Additionally, the MPH is also a place where students can showcase their talents during lunchtime performances.  
  
During examination periods, the MPH is a conducive study area for students in the afternoons and evenings.
