Located next to the Science Laboratory block, the College’s Green Houses is a collaborative project between the College Interact Club and Arise & Farm, with sponsorship by Temasek and NETA Foundations. In alignment with Singapore’s Green Plan and food Security initiative, our GreenHouses give insights on urban farming and the opportunities for our students and staff to learn more about harnessing a sustainable green economy for Singapore.
