A purpose-built art studio, the Art Room is used as a teaching and learning space for students taking Art at the GCE A-Level subject. The space comprises two rooms that can be integrated, housing a variety of contemporary and traditional resources exclusively for our studentsâ€™ creative use. Students hone their aesthetic skills with traditional modes and mediums of art-making supplemented with contemporary tools such as iMac workstations for time-based digital artworks. Additionally, the College has exhibition spaces for students' curatorial practice and assessment as well as specially built storage spaces for material storage and artwork archival.
