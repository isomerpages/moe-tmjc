The Plaza is usually used as the assembly area every morning for our Flag-Raising Ceremony. Nestled at the heart of the campus, the Plaza serves as a locus for the College to build our spirit and camaraderie amongst students. The Plaza plays a significant part in our studentâ€™s lives as memorable events such as TM Celebrates, JC1 Initiation, and Badge Pinning Ceremony, and Open House are traditionally held here.
