At the heart of the Atrium, the Heritage Gallery commemorates the history, leadership, and milestones of our two parent colleges. The Gallery houses an enclosed underground terrarium grown from soil dug from both sites of our parent colleges. Buried in the ground, as well, are time capsules containing 32 artifacts from Tampines JC and 15 from Meridian JC symbolising the number of years the two colleges were in operation before the merger. With an interactive digital platform, visitors are also able to browse through the comprehensive history of both our parent colleges.

Peppered around the Atrium are many study benches for studentsâ€™ to use.
