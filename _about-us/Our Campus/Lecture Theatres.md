In TMJC, there are five lecture theatres with different seating capacities,Â  including our largest offers a 600-seater, to best cater to the different lecture groups for the various subjects. All our lecture theatres are well-equipped with ICT support for conducting mass lectures and at the same time provide a conducive learning space for students. With our TMJC Lecture Recording System, all lectures are recorded to allow students to experience continual and self-directed learning.
