On 20 April 2017, MOE announced the merger of Tampines Junior College (TPJC) and Meridian Junior College (MJC). The merged JC began operations in January 2019 at the MJC site as Tampines Meridian Junior College (TMJC).  
  
TMJC is built upon the foundations of Tampines Junior College and Meridian Junior College.  With the rich heritage and culture of two colleges coming together, TMJC is thus able to offer a wider range of educational experiences and enrichment programmes for students to realise his/her potential.  TMJC will continue the good practices of both parent colleges to develop students to be persons with strong self-awareness, a sound moral compass, and the relevant skills and knowledge to be future-ready, and contribute actively and meaningfully to the community and nation.
