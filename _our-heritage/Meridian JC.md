Meridian Junior College (MJC) was established in 2003 after DPM Teo Chee Hean, the then-Education Minister, mooted the idea of building a new junior college in Pasir Ris. “Meridian” refers to a line in astronomy which measures the highest point a star reaches as it journeys across the night sky. It also refers to the point of highest achievement and greatest splendour. Thus, the word “Meridian” aptly paints the image of this new college’s vision for itself. On 25th February 2005, the College hosted its official opening ceremony and the inaugural College Day was held on 23rd July that same year.
