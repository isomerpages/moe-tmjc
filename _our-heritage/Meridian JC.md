### College History

Meridian Junior College (MJC) was established in 2003 after DPM Teo Chee Hean, the then-Education Minister, mooted the idea of building a new junior college in Pasir Ris. “Meridian” refers to a line in astronomy which measures the highest point a star reaches as it journeys across the night sky. It also refers to the point of highest achievement and greatest splendour. Thus, the word “Meridian” aptly paints the image of this new college’s vision for itself. On 25th February 2005, the College hosted its official opening ceremony and the inaugural College Day was held on 23rd July that same year.

Ms Esther Lai was the first principal of Meridian Junior College. Under her leadership, the College focussed on realising its vision – to be a leading institution that gave the best educational experience for its students. The College quickly grew by leaps and bounds. From “the college in Pasir Ris”, it became one of the most popular JCs in the east. This clarity of purpose spurred MJC to grow quickly to became a college of choice, defined by its values Courage, Purpose, Character, and shaped by its core approach to holistic student development Construct, Connect, Cultivate.

Mr Lim Yan Hock (2015-2018) continue to build  upon the strong foundations of the College by focusing on the holistic development of students as well as staff. New infrastructural innovations such as the Lecture Recording System helped students better manage self-directed learning, while new awards such as the Meridian Staff Service Award deepened staff’s sense of purpose and belonging to the College. Mr Lim also oversaw the smooth merger process with Tampines JC.

Meridian Junior College is greatly indebted to Professor Tan Teck Meng for the invaluable advice and ideas that he provided to help the school, and his deep generosity in supporting the students and staff in so many ways. A case in point would be how he helped needy students tide through financial difficulties by personally donating $10,000 to seed a bursary fund. To encourage MJC’s top students to aspire to greater heights, he came up with the idea to turn his own 60th birthday celebration into a fund-raising event, donating all monetary gifts amounting to $72,000 to start MJC’s own scholarship fund. In honour of his commitment to the development of Meridian students, the scholarship was named The Professor Tan Teck Meng Scholarship. In its fledgling years, MJC owed much of its steady growth to Prof Tan, and his legacy lives on in the scores of students he has helped.

Dr Jeremy Lim was the College’s second and longest-serving SAC Chairman. A medical doctor by training, he has now ventured into consulting and advising multi-national clients in the healthcare sector and volunteering with various NGOs. At heart, he is an educator: besides holding appointments in a number of universities, he also conducts courses for university students and writes regularly for both the scientific and popular media. MJC had the good fortune to be touched by his big-hearted gestures of appreciating the hard work of teachers, through sumptuous feasts and generous support. In recognition of his outstanding contributions to the College, Dr Lim was presented with the MOE Service to Education Award in 2015.

MJC’s Sports Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) always had a firm place in the hearts of Meridians. There were many memorable moments. The Wushu, Taekwondo, Floorball and Football teams all performed consistently well in the annual National Inter-school games. Most notably, since 2004, the Football Boys team had dominated the A Division scene with 13 finals and 9 Championship titles.

Apart from the Sports CCAs, the Performing Arts groups also undertook many hours of practice to fine-tune their craft. Their awe-inspiring performances on stage bore testament to their hard work and talent. A case in point would be how the College’s Choir, Guitar Ensemble, Symphonic Band, Dance Society, English Drama Club and Chinese Orchestra always did the College proud at public performances and at the Singapore Youth Festival.

Relate & Enrich with Affection, Compassion and Hope (REACH) Projects

What also made MJC special was the active role that every student played in giving back to the community. This was accomplished through REACH, a bottom-up, student-led, service-learning programme that focussed on developing long-term partnerships with charitable organisations, both locally and overseas. Through various platforms like Youth Connect!, blood donation drives and fund-raising events, students learnt about social issues and became advocates for the less privileged in the community.

Nothing makes for good stories as when old friends meet. In March 2017, scores of Meridians gathered as part of the Homecoming 15th Anniversary celebrations. It was a special moment as the Meridian family reminisced about the story of MJC, and how it began with an empty plot of land in Pasir Ris. Teachers, too, shared that they were specially selected to be part of the dynamic team that would help launch the College. A sense of pride and accomplishment filled the air during the celebrations. Meridians felt that they had indeed done their best to grow the College into a leading institution acclaimed for its pursuit of excellence and richness of learning experiences.

Construct-Connect-Cultivate was MJC’s holistic curriculum framework that aimed to prepare students for the 21st Century to embody the traits of engaged Global Citizens, Critical Thinkers, Self-Directed Learners, Confident Communicators and Collaborators, and Strength of Character.
