### College History and Background

Tampines Junior College commenced operations with a pioneer cohort of 698 students and 33 teachers on 11 April 1986 in temporary premises. It was only on 20 December 1986 that it moved to its location along Tampines Avenue 9. Designed by P&T architects, the College received the Best Designed College Building Award for 1988. It was officially opened on 1 July 1988 by then Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Defence) and Member of Parliament for Tampines, Mr Phua Bah Lee.

Under the leadership of founding Principal, Mr Yahya Aljaru, the students and staff formulated a college vision and mission focussed on academic excellence and character development, and launched the development of programmes to achieve these two goals. The close collaboration and synergy between the pioneer students, staff and College management laid the foundation for the TPJCian identity. Each succeeding Principal furthered and enriched this process of development: Mr Lee Kah Chuen from 1993 to 1997, Mrs Susan Chan from 1997 to 2002, Mrs Goh Hwee Choo from 2002 to 2006,  Ms Helen Choo from 2006 to 2014 and Ms Pamela Yoong from 2014 to 2018.

Since its founding in 1986, the College, driven by the desire to continually aim higher and achieve more, grew immeasurably. The College mission, “To inculcate excellence of achievement, a passion for learning and a zest for life”, captured the essence of our nation’s Desired Outcomes of Education. The vision, “A Leader in Every Student”, encapsulated the ideal of holistic development through a fully rounded education. The College’s key core values of Responsibility, Integrity, Courage and Humility underpinned these qualities with fundamental moral and communal values. It was upon this foundation that the College set its aspirations and direction.

As the educational landscape became more diversified, students embarked on a journey that sought to develop within them a zest for innovation, a passion for enterprise, and the imagination to be truly creative. The College worked towards the creation of an even more challenging environment of intellectual exchange that would provide greater opportunities for TPJC students to broaden their worldview, grow socially and develop as leaders in preparation for the realities of the globalised economy. The College also continued to rise to the demands of the present and future guided by the unchanging ideal of its motto, ‘Aim & Achieve’.

Mr Yahya Aljaru founded Tampines Junior College and was its Principal from 1986 to 1992. As the College’s first Principal, he put in place processes that empowered teachers and helped students realise their potential. He was best remembered as a humble and compassionate man who dedicated his life to helping and serving others. By encouraging staff and students to work closely together and to offer views and suggestions to contribute to the progress of the College, he built a close-knit family and nurtured the “kampong spirit” in TPJC. A firm believer in a holistic education, he led the College in developing compassionate young men and women who served their community and put others before self. It was precisely this spirit that guided the College in its vision and mission of serving the community.

Mr Lee Kah Chuen opened the College to the growing Tampines community through two Fun Fairs. College spirit and unity were further strengthened as students and staff collaborated well to ensure the success of these ventures. The funds raised from these events contributed significantly to improvements in infrastructure to accommodate the College’s increasing student population.

Mrs Susan Chan was a firm supporter of the performing arts groups and under her leadership, the College showcased the many talents of its students. Public performances such as the Malay Cultural Society’s Manifestasi and the College’s staging of The Mikado were instrumental in putting TPJC on the arts map. TPJC was also invited to host the MOE Malay Elective Programme.
