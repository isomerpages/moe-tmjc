### MLEP Scholarship Presentation

This year, six students from TMJC’s Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) were awarded the MLEP Scholarship. They are Amirah Binte Mohamed Zailan (20A102), Muhammad Nabil Bin Jasiman (20A102), Amirah Binte Ahmad Khairy (20A301), Nur Aisyah Amirah Binte Muhamad Akasah (20A302), Nur Haziqah Binte Hashim (20S502) and Muhammad Ali Bin Iskandar Muda Abdul Jalil (20S502).

The students had to go through a rigorous selection process based on their outstanding overall results in the GCE O-Level Examinations especially in the Malay language, Higher Malay Language or Malay literature. In addition, these students also underwent intensive scholarship selection interviews via Zoom due to the safety restrictions put in place to combat Covid-19.

The college would like to extend our heartiest congratulations to the awardees! Well-done students!

### Showing Our Support for Frontliners at the Regional Screening Centre (former site of Siglap Secondary School)  
  
Celebrating the birthdays of our Nation and College is made more meaningful when we can bring joy to others. TMJC staff and students, in collaboration with Pasir Ris West Grassroots Organisation, showed their appreciation for personnel at the Regional Screening Centre (located at the former site of Siglap Secondary School), with a special treat sponsored by the College’s CAC member Mr. Mohamed Faizal S/O Mohamed Abdul Kadir. Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean also showed his support for this effort by sharing it on his Facebook page (you can see the post [here](https://www.facebook.com/115495911861927/posts/3030595340351955/?d=n)).

### 2020 National Day & TM Celebrates!

Today, TMJC celebrated its second anniversary, as the nation celebrates Singapore's 55th birthday!To mark this special day, the College put together a unique programme that was safe, engaging, and meaningful. After participating in a special National Day Observance Ceremony, staff and students proceeded to play innovative games that tested their knowledge of national as well as college history and culture.  These games were played within classes to minimise intermingling of groups. The finale required each class to contribute a piece of a jigsaw puzzle that came together to spell “Together As One Singapore”, the official NDP logo, signifying our unity and strength even though we may be socially-distanced.   

Part of the celebrations also included the launch of a set of College caricatures, lovingly illustrated by our alumni Alyn Quak (18A302), as well as a new set of College track suit, designed by students.

To celebrate the values of kindness and show our care for the community, the College also came together to participate in the President’s Challenge where funds were raised through sales of meal packs, hand-sewn masks and other goodies from our staff and our canteen vendors. We are pleased to share that our efforts raised close to $3,500 for charity! 

Happy Birthday, Singapore! Happy Birthday TMJC!

### Racial Harmony Day 2020

TMJC commemorated Racial Harmony Day this year under the theme “Singapore’s evolving multiculturalism: Challenges & Opportunities.” The 3-part commemoration helped students appreciate Singapore’s fragile racial harmony on a deeper level by connecting them with recent developments that have the potential to disrupt it.

Part 1 was commemorated online on the Citizenship Education site. Key highlights included two video surveys of how our newly minted Citizenship Education Ambassadors and their peers feel towards managing race issues in Singapore.

Part 2 consisted of a Labyrinth maze exhibition that was held in the Hall on 29 and 30 July. The multisensorial exhibition functioned as a metaphor of Singapore’s arduous journey towards fostering a multicultural identity. With social distancing and safety measures in place, all JC1 and JC2 students took turns to participate in the exhibition in groups and many came out unnerved but enriched, with a renewed sense of purpose to protect Singapore’s racial harmony.

Students will also extend their dialogues about race and religion in Singapore through a follow-up CCE lesson, which makes up Part 3. Through these activities and dialogues, it is hoped that students will develop a love for diversity in ways that safeguard Singapore’s multicultural harmony.

### Straight from the heart: 19A201 thanks School Leaders, EAS and school attendants

On 28th and 29th July, 19A201 presented hampers and goodie bags to the School Leaders, the EAS and school attendants to thank them for their hard work in keeping the College safe through these challenging times amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

The class came up with the idea on their own, and as contributions poured in, what was initially planned as simple “Blessing Bags” filled with origami cranes and snacks, grew to include two big hampers filled with goodies and lots of love. Thank you, 19A201, for the thoughtful gesture!
