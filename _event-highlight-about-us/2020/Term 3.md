### MLEP Scholarship Presentation

This year, six students from TMJC’s Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) were awarded the MLEP Scholarship. They are Amirah Binte Mohamed Zailan (20A102), Muhammad Nabil Bin Jasiman (20A102), Amirah Binte Ahmad Khairy (20A301), Nur Aisyah Amirah Binte Muhamad Akasah (20A302), Nur Haziqah Binte Hashim (20S502) and Muhammad Ali Bin Iskandar Muda Abdul Jalil (20S502).

The students had to go through a rigorous selection process based on their outstanding overall results in the GCE O-Level Examinations especially in the Malay language, Higher Malay Language or Malay literature. In addition, these students also underwent intensive scholarship selection interviews via Zoom due to the safety restrictions put in place to combat Covid-19.

The college would like to extend our heartiest congratulations to the awardees! Well-done students!
