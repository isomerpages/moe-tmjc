### MLEP Scholarship Presentation

This year, six students from TMJC’s Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) were awarded the MLEP Scholarship. They are Amirah Binte Mohamed Zailan (20A102), Muhammad Nabil Bin Jasiman (20A102), Amirah Binte Ahmad Khairy (20A301), Nur Aisyah Amirah Binte Muhamad Akasah (20A302), Nur Haziqah Binte Hashim (20S502) and Muhammad Ali Bin Iskandar Muda Abdul Jalil (20S502).

The students had to go through a rigorous selection process based on their outstanding overall results in the GCE O-Level Examinations especially in the Malay language, Higher Malay Language or Malay literature. In addition, these students also underwent intensive scholarship selection interviews via Zoom due to the safety restrictions put in place to combat Covid-19.

The college would like to extend our heartiest congratulations to the awardees! Well-done students!

### Showing Our Support for Frontliners at the Regional Screening Centre (former site of Siglap Secondary School)  
  
Celebrating the birthdays of our Nation and College is made more meaningful when we can bring joy to others. TMJC staff and students, in collaboration with Pasir Ris West Grassroots Organisation, showed their appreciation for personnel at the Regional Screening Centre (located at the former site of Siglap Secondary School), with a special treat sponsored by the College’s CAC member Mr. Mohamed Faizal S/O Mohamed Abdul Kadir. Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean also showed his support for this effort by sharing it on his Facebook page (you can see the post [here](https://www.facebook.com/115495911861927/posts/3030595340351955/?d=n)).

### 2020 National Day & TM Celebrates!

Today, TMJC celebrated its second anniversary, as the nation celebrates Singapore's 55th birthday!To mark this special day, the College put together a unique programme that was safe, engaging, and meaningful. After participating in a special National Day Observance Ceremony, staff and students proceeded to play innovative games that tested their knowledge of national as well as college history and culture.  These games were played within classes to minimise intermingling of groups. The finale required each class to contribute a piece of a jigsaw puzzle that came together to spell “Together As One Singapore”, the official NDP logo, signifying our unity and strength even though we may be socially-distanced.   

Part of the celebrations also included the launch of a set of College caricatures, lovingly illustrated by our alumni Alyn Quak (18A302), as well as a new set of College track suit, designed by students.

To celebrate the values of kindness and show our care for the community, the College also came together to participate in the President’s Challenge where funds were raised through sales of meal packs, hand-sewn masks and other goodies from our staff and our canteen vendors. We are pleased to share that our efforts raised close to $3,500 for charity! 

Happy Birthday, Singapore! Happy Birthday TMJC!

### Racial Harmony Day 2020

TMJC commemorated Racial Harmony Day this year under the theme “Singapore’s evolving multiculturalism: Challenges & Opportunities.” The 3-part commemoration helped students appreciate Singapore’s fragile racial harmony on a deeper level by connecting them with recent developments that have the potential to disrupt it.

Part 1 was commemorated online on the Citizenship Education site. Key highlights included two video surveys of how our newly minted Citizenship Education Ambassadors and their peers feel towards managing race issues in Singapore.

Part 2 consisted of a Labyrinth maze exhibition that was held in the Hall on 29 and 30 July. The multisensorial exhibition functioned as a metaphor of Singapore’s arduous journey towards fostering a multicultural identity. With social distancing and safety measures in place, all JC1 and JC2 students took turns to participate in the exhibition in groups and many came out unnerved but enriched, with a renewed sense of purpose to protect Singapore’s racial harmony.

Students will also extend their dialogues about race and religion in Singapore through a follow-up CCE lesson, which makes up Part 3. Through these activities and dialogues, it is hoped that students will develop a love for diversity in ways that safeguard Singapore’s multicultural harmony.

### Straight from the heart: 19A201 thanks School Leaders, EAS and school attendants

On 28th and 29th July, 19A201 presented hampers and goodie bags to the School Leaders, the EAS and school attendants to thank them for their hard work in keeping the College safe through these challenging times amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

The class came up with the idea on their own, and as contributions poured in, what was initially planned as simple “Blessing Bags” filled with origami cranes and snacks, grew to include two big hampers filled with goodies and lots of love. Thank you, 19A201, for the thoughtful gesture!

![](/images/2020-T3-Events-Chan%20Choon%20Yong_01.jpeg)

Chan Choon Yong from 18S101 was among the 23 youths who were awarded the PSC Scholarship 2020, and will be pursuing a double degree in Computer Science and Statistics at the National University of Singapore (NUS).In an interview with Channel News Asia, Choon Yong shared that it was his childhood dream to become an “ethical hacker”, channelling his passion for computer science and programming to hone his knowledge and skills and use them for the public good.   

An A\*STAR Science Award winner, Choon Yong’s keen interest and talent in programming was evident while he was a student at TMJC. The student team he led represented the college at the inaugural Cyberthon Competition jointly organised by Hwa Chong Institute and MINDEF, and emerged Overall 2nd Runner Up. He also played a key role in helping the team clinch the Technovative Award at the Nanyang Technological University's School of Computer Science and Engineering Computing Challenge.

The College is proud of Choon Yong’s achievements and wishes him the very best as he continues to pursue his passion.

### Staff Learning Symposium 2020

TMJC held its Staff Learning Symposium on 20 July.

The theme of the Symposium was “Our HBL Experience”. After two months of Full Home Based Learning (FHBL) and many more weeks of some form of HBL, our teachers had not really had the opportunity to pause and take stock of what they did right, and areas for further improvement.  This Symposium was therefore put together to make space and time for such critical professional reflections.

This Symposium also builds upon an earlier staff professional module that was conducted remotely on the SLS platform in March. This module focused on Assessment for Learning (AfL) within the context of the College’s Teaching and Learning (T&L) Framework. 

The Symposium facilitators made use of the College’s T&L Framework as well as Mishra and Koehler’s TPACK framework as tools to guide teachers in their reflections on their HBL experiences. Using individualised worksheets as well as online collaborative tools such as Padlet, the teachers articulated and deepened their understanding of their HBL efforts.

And, in strict adherence to safe distancing measures, staff were masked up throughout the event, and sat apart from one another. But this could not stop our staff from learning, and deepening their professional practice!

### Staff Promotion Ceremony 2020

On 20 July, TMJC held its Staff Promotion Ceremony to recognise and celebrate staff achievements and contributions. Safety was, of course, paramount, and the event was held in compliance with safe distancing measures – everyone wore masks and sat at least a metre apart from others; there were no handshakes; and photographs were taken where staff stood on clearly marked spots on the stage to ensure safe distancing.  

Everyone took the measures seriously and that did nothing to dampen the warm spirit of communal joy in celebrating our fellow colleagues’ promotions and long-service awards. The climax of the event was the presentation of the special MOE Outstanding Contribution Awards for staff’s COVID-related work. Teams such as School Attendants and Data Management were presented with the OCA, along with a monetary award, to recognise their extraordinary efforts in specific areas of work to help keep the college safe for students and staff during these difficult times.

### Schools Work Plan Seminar 2020, EZ JC/IP Cluster Engagement

On 16 July, representative key personnel from the respective East Zone junior colleges and integrated programme schools met over Zoom for the Schools Work Plan Seminar 2020, East Zone JC/IP Cluster Engagement.

This first-of-its-kind session targeted at JCs and IP schools was helmed by the Cluster Superintendents and school leaders to facilitate discussions about what the new normal would be like for the Singapore education system. The engagement session also discussed how blended learning could take place in schools. The engagement session engendered much candid and insightful exchanges between the participants.

### TMJC students pledge support for the Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign 2020
  
On 17 June, our JC1 students folded ribbons during their respective morning CT admin time in support of the Anti-Drug Abuse campaign organized by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB). In all, the cohort pledged a total of 1466 ribbons in support of a drug-free SG!

### Happy Father’s (and Mother’s) Day!

This week at TMJC, to honour fatherhood and show appreciation for the love and care that fathers shower on their family, all the members of staff were treated to a yummy delight of pastries, pies and muffins, lovingly sponsored by our dear Principal, Ms Yoong! Also, in this special year, since it is not possible for students to present carnations to staff on Mother’s Day in May, we took this opportunity to present these yummy treats to the moms too!

Happy Father’s (& belated Mother’s) Day, everyone!

### Back to College After Circuit Breaker!

On 2nd June, students and staff returned to college after almost two months of Circuit Breaker measures.For these two weeks, the JC2 students will be back in college while the JC1s continue with HBL. Everyone dutifully donned their masks and queued patiently to be scanned for entry. There was a strange mix of excitement and seriousness in the air – excited to finally be back at college and to meet fellow students and teachers, but also seriousness because everyone was vigilant about following the safety measures put in place.  

Ms Yoong, our principal, together with the school leadership team, addressed the staff and the students separately over several sessions, to welcome everyone back and reiterate the importance of adhering to SAFE measures (**S**afe distancing; **A**dhere to well-being practices; **F**ollow Seating Arrangements; **E**ncourage good hygiene practices). Everyone was also treated to fresh apples, courtesy of the college, to symbolise a healthy beginning to Term 3, and to remember to stay healthy!
