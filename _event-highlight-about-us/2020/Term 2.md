### A Mother's Day Message from PSD... and Clara!

Ms Clara Pay is MOE's representative in Public Service Division's (PSD) Mother's Day video, and she has a message of her own for all mothers out there!

### "Whose job is never done?"

Our teacher, Ms Clara Pay, has been featured on MOE's Schoolbag New Site.   
  
In the article, "Whose job is never done?", Clara takes us through a slice of her typical day in this Circuit Breaker period, where she balances the needs of her toddler son, preparing for and conducting HBL with her own classes, and running the household, all the while nursing a 35-week pregnancy, and without a helper!

### International Friendship Day 2020: "Beyond Borders"

On 17 April, TMJC commemorated International Friendship Day, with a twist, amidst the evolving COVID-19 situation – we celebrated it online.

The theme was ‘Beyond Borders’ and the commemoration focused on deepening students’ understanding of ASEAN, one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.

Staff and students came together to create and curate a series of multimedia presentations that featured interesting and unique sights, sounds and stories of Southeast Asia.

A key highlight was the video presentation by our group of enthusiastic foreign students who wanted to share light-hearted anecdotes of life in their home countries. 

Students from **ExpLORE!** 2019, TMJC’s signature overseas immersion progamme, also shared their reflections on their personal growth and wonderful friendships made during their trips to China and Vietnam last year.

All in all, TMJC’s International Friendship Day 2020 online commemoration programme raised cultural awareness among the wider student population, expanding their horizons and building their confidence as empowered individuals in an increasingly diverse world.   

  
### Thank you for cheering us on!

In the thick of this Full HBL period, where our staff continue to put in their best to enable and support student learning, it was most heartwarming when we received a hamper filled with warm wishes and thoughtfully curated snacks.

To the anonymous “grateful teacher cum parent” who sent this beautiful hamper to cheer us on, TMJC would like to say a big “Thank you!” 

  
### Words of encouragement for our students!

Here is a heartfelt message put together by the Principals of Pre-University programmes in Singapore to all their students.  
  
Stay Home! Stay Safe! Stay Curious!

### This is how we do HBL and WFH!

On 3rd April, our staff and students engaged in our first HBL exercise. And from the experience gained there, we were ready when Full HBL kicked in on 8th April, and set to last almost a month till 4th May.

We are glad to see that students and teachers alike embraced the HBL experience enthusiastically (for our teachers it is “WFH” – Working From Home). Some students even continued to wear the college uniform proudly when Zoom-ing online!

There were the usual and expected technical glitches, but by and large, HBL has gone on well, whether it be on Zoom, SLS, Google Classroom, or just traditional paper-and-pen worksheets.

Our PE lessons have also gone online, with, for example, the TMJC Tabata Challenge series of videos that our PE teachers have produced to challenge our students to self-manage their own physical conditioning during Full HBL.

And just to prove that HBL and WFH amidst COVID can still have that human touch, students in one class were so sweet to surprise their teacher with birthday well-wishes!  
  
### TMJC Cares!
  
Amidst the busyness of making preparations for HBL, the TMJC family also did not forget to find time to show care and concern for one another.

On 27th March, our Staff Welfare Committee (SWC) gave out hand sanitisers to all our staff, personalised with a message for everyone to stay safe! Thank you, SWC!

On 1st April, Ms Yoong presented, on behalf of the College, bottled honey to our colleagues with immediate family members who are healthcare workers, to show our deepest appreciation to them for their dedication to protecting all of us. Hopefully the honey will sweeten up their days and keep them healthy!

 On their own accord, staff also cheered each other on! Some of our teachers got together to encourage our support staff with a hamper of goodies, thanking them for their efforts in keeping the college clean and safe.

 Together, WE can fight the virus!
