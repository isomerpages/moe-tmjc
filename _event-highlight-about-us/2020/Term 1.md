On 13 March, the students and staff worked together to give the college a thorough wipe-down to keep it clean and safe.

A student-initiated campaign, inspired by SG Clean, TMJC SPARKLES! demonstrates the TMJC spirit where we take charge of maintaining our cleanliness and safety by practising wipe-downs of common facilities before we go for our March holiday break.  
  

### 2019 A-Level Results Celebratory Treat

### Release of 2019 A-Level Results

Our cohort of 2018-2019 had a unique experience collecting their A-Level results today. The seniors cooperated with the all necessary precautionary measures that were put in place to ensure a smooth and safe collection process, such as temperature checks at the gate and decentralised collection in class rooms instead of the hall. In college, our seniors still had the opportunity to catch up with their peers as well as their teachers while collecting their results. There were also platforms for our seniors to consult with their tutors and ECG counsellors about university admissions and career paths.

To the cohort of 2019-2019, TMJC is proud of you and your achievements! 

### TREE-PLANTING CEREMONY 21 February 2020
  
On 21 February 2020, TMJC held its first tree-planting ceremony.  
  
This ceremony commemorates the shared experiences and achievements of each cohort of students. The tree-planting ceremony will be carried out for each cohort of students, and it is intended that the open area where the tembusu trees are planted will be fondly known as “Tembusu Lane”.

Why a tembusu tree? A tembusu tree is a large, evergreen tree that matures with stately beauty, and can provide shelter for all. It is highly robust and can grow in almost any type of soil, testifying to its resilience. Such attributes symbolise the values and character that the College hopes to imbue in TMJC students.  
  
This inaugural ceremony was led by the school leaders, together with student representatives from the 2018-2019 batch. The students representatives are from the 2018-2019 Students’ Council :  Teo Jun Rui Jonathan (18S201/ Vice-President), Toh How Cher Andy (18S404/ Vice-President); Jolin Teo Hui Lyn (18S415 / Vice President) and Nur Razza Farwyzah Bte Abdul Razak (18A202/ House Vice-Captain).

### “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”: Total Defence Day 2020
  
On 14 February 2019, TMJC commemorated Total Defence Day.

The theme “Together We Keep Singapore Strong” was put into action by our staff and students as we came together to show our resilience as a community, and also our support for frontline staff who are keeping us safe from Covid-19.

First, to actively keep our shared spaces clean safe, both staff and students mindfully practised good personal hygiene and social hygiene protocols, such as proper hand-washing and wiping down their canteen table surfaces after meals. Our teachers even put together a short and fun instructional video to remind ourselves of these simple but important steps.

Second, our students took initiative to show their gratitude to and solidarity with our frontline staff. They presented welfare packs and tokens of appreciation to the EAS, school attendants and security guards who work hard everyday to keep the college clean and safe from the virus. Our students also put up many, many heartfelt well-wishing cards, cheering on and thanking Singapore’s frontline staff who are battling the virus and saving lives.

Finally, our students were also kept updated about Covid-19 through the launch of a new interactive ‘Citizenship Education’ website, developed in-house by TMJC staff. In view of fake news circulating on social media that cause unnecessary panic, students learnt that they play an important role in promoting Psychological Defence among family and friends when they share facts about the Covid-19 situation to assuage their fears.  
  
Together, we play our part in the defence of Singapore and keep her strong!  

  

### Staying strong together: TMJC sends apples in gesture of solidarity and support for VJC
