### TMJC participates in SBS Transit Kindness Month

In conjunction with SBS Transit Kindness Month, TMJC students prepared handwritten cards and gift packs for the staff working at Tampines Bus Interchange and the Tampines Downtown Line MRT Station. Our student representatives were glad to have the opportunity to personally express their gratitude while distributing these gift packs to the bus captains and other personnel at the premises.    
  
As the school year comes to an end, the TMJC family would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to all those who have been tirelessly working to ensure that our daily commute to school is smooth and safe.

### Singapore Schools Sports Council (SSSC) Colours Award (Distinction): Raiyan Lee Shukran (19S304)
  
Raiyan Lee Shukran from 19S304 was recently awarded the Singapore Schools Sports Council Colours Award (Distinction) for representing the country at the South East Asian Games 2019 in baseball.

 Raiyan started out playing softball in primary school and transferred his skills and knowledge of the game to baseball. His excellent performance in the game earned him a place in the national team that represented Singapore at the 2019 South-East Asian Games in Philippines. At that point, Raiyan was also the youngest member of the national team.

 Raiyan is an avid sportsman. Besides baseball, he also developed a passion for rockclimbing when he joined the college in 2019. The concentration and resilience needed to challenge difficult courses in rockclimbing helps Raiyan sharpen his focus and propels him to compete at a higher level in the game of baseball. Raiyan also shared that the rigorous national training routine built up his mental toughness, improved his time management skills, and helped him to maintain a clear focus on his goals.

Congratulations, Raiyan! We are proud of your achievements!

The next segment involved an online concert with well wishes and messages put together by both staff and JC1 students to encourage the graduating cohort to strive for their best at the A Levels.

 Mementos which included a Farewell Booklet and a special edition mask case was also specially prepared for the cohort. On top of that, Student Leaders also received a charging cable kit in appreciation of their service and contribution.
