### TMJC participates in SBS Transit Kindness Month

In conjunction with SBS Transit Kindness Month, TMJC students prepared handwritten cards and gift packs for the staff working at Tampines Bus Interchange and the Tampines Downtown Line MRT Station. Our student representatives were glad to have the opportunity to personally express their gratitude while distributing these gift packs to the bus captains and other personnel at the premises.    
  
As the school year comes to an end, the TMJC family would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to all those who have been tirelessly working to ensure that our daily commute to school is smooth and safe.
