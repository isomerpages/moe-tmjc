### Leadership Training Camp (LTC) 2019

TMJC’s 200 newly-minted JC1 student leaders recently spent three days and two nights together at Camp Challenge in Sembawang to participate in the college’s Leadership Training Camp 2019.  
  
At the camp, our student leaders were challenged to go beyond their comfort zones as they conquered High Element stations and worked together in teams to solve problems. Through these processes, they learnt how to be an exemplary leader by applying the five leadership practices of The Leadership Challenge.

The camp closed on a high note as the student leaders organized a rousing camp-fire, where camp camaraderie and the TMJC college spirit were on full display. We wish our student leaders a meaningful leadership journey ahead!  
  
  
### Pre-University Seminar 2019

Our students joined their peers from other post-secondary institutions, such as the polytechnics, integrated programme (IP) and international schools at NUS to explore this year’s Seminar theme: “Singapore 4.0: What Next?” The theme directs the participants’ attention to the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the role of technology in shaping the future. Our students were given the chance to learn, envision and imagine the future of Singapore, a future that they will own and co-create. Their hard work culminated in an exhibition on the last day of the Seminar, where they proudly presented their projects to guests from the Ministry of Education as well as the staff and students from other institutions. The entire Seminar was closed by Minister of Education Mr Ong Ye Kung.

Our students shared that they learnt much through this whole experience: they relished the opportunity to discuss Singapore’s future, as well as the friendships they made with one another, and with their peers from other institutions.

### College Day Celebrations 2019

On 3 and 4 May, TMJC proudly hosted the respective College Day cum Home-coming of its two parent colleges, Tampines Junior College and Meridian Junior College.

On both days, former students and their parents, staff, college advisory committee members, and other college partners gathered at TMJC to celebrate the achievements of the final cohorts from both colleges. Beyond academic achievements, the College Days also recognised students for their exemplary leadership and character.

Both College Days also served as Home-Coming events for the respective parent colleges, as former students and staff, beyond awardees, were invited back for a reunion. At the respective lunch and dinner receptions, there were much laughter and conversation as the guests reminisced on shared memories.  

 We hope our guests had a memorable and meaningful College Day, and that our former students from both parent colleges will look upon TMJC as their shared alma mater, and to come back to inspire their juniors to aim high and go far.

### English Drama Performance
![](/images/Club_1.jpeg)

The (English) Drama CCA performed to 3 sold out shows at Centre 42 along Waterloo Street on the 26th and 27th April 2019.

![](/images/drama.jpeg)

The show, titled _the first person i ever hated was myself_, was the result of a collaborative script writing effort between the CCA’s Director Ms Ellison Tan and the current batch of JC2 students. The piece explores the angst and struggles experienced by youths in society today, how they learn to be honest about feelings they do not always know how to articulate, and how they try to come to terms with these feelings. 

  
  
### TMJChoir SYF 2019
![](/images/TMJChoir%20SYF%202019_3.jpeg)
Tampines Meridian Junior College’s Choir participated in their first Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation 2019 on 17th April 2019.
![](/images/TMJChoir%20SYF%202019_1.jpeg)

The journey leading up to the SYF Presentation was certainly not an easy one as the choristers had to master the songs with a comprehensive understanding of every sections’ parts, to create depth and give colour to the song, and bring meaning to the text they sing. Through this, they learnt the importance of self discipline and how an ensemble works because the essence of any song could only be conveyed when they voices blended seamlessly together. All these would not have been possible without the tireless effort and dedication of everyone - from the singers to the teachers and the conductor.

 The enrichment activity was a talk by local renowned director Eva Tang on her documentary “The Songs We Sang”. Through snippets and anecdotes of the documentary, Ms Tang shared with students about the origin and history of Xinyao which once swept the nation from the 1980s. The talk was peppered with live performances by Huang Hongmo, whom along with Liang Wern Fook and others, are seen as pioneers of the genre.

As part of MT Enrichment Day, the Malay Language Unit organised a Cultural Trail for all students taking H1 Malay Language and H2 Malay Language and Literature. The cultural trail was an exciting race to various booths that tested the students’ cultural knowledge. For example, students had to identify tunes from traditional Malay musical instruments such as ‘rebana’ and ‘gong’. They also had the opportunity to identify various herbs and spices used in Malay cuisine as well as guess names of traditional Malay desserts. The students had fun competing against and sharing their cultural knowledge with one another, and the event ended with a delicious feast of traditional Malay desserts such as ‘putri salat’ and ‘nagasari’.             
  
**Tamil Beyond Classrooms**

The Tamil Unit organised a speech and drama workshop as part of the MTL Enrichment Day for Tamil students. The workshop was run by a popular Vasantham TV personality Mr Nagaraj who is an accomplished stage drama artiste. The students were engaged in a variety of drama techniques and speech articulation techniques and had fun as they re-enacted little skits with their peers to practice the techniques taught. It was a great time of bonding for all Tamil Students as H1 TL, H2 TLL, TLB and HTL students were involved in the workshop. The 3 hour workshop was a new and interesting experience for students as they discovered their talents in acting and oracy skills.
