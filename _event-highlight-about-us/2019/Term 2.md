### Leadership Training Camp (LTC) 2019

TMJC’s 200 newly-minted JC1 student leaders recently spent three days and two nights together at Camp Challenge in Sembawang to participate in the college’s Leadership Training Camp 2019.  
  
At the camp, our student leaders were challenged to go beyond their comfort zones as they conquered High Element stations and worked together in teams to solve problems. Through these processes, they learnt how to be an exemplary leader by applying the five leadership practices of The Leadership Challenge.

The camp closed on a high note as the student leaders organized a rousing camp-fire, where camp camaraderie and the TMJC college spirit were on full display. We wish our student leaders a meaningful leadership journey ahead!  
  
  
### Pre-University Seminar 2019  

Over the first week of the June holidays, a team of twenty TMJC student representatives participated in the annual Pre-University Seminar. This year also marks Pre-U Seminar’s fiftieth anniversary and the event was opened by Deputy Prime Minister Mr Heng Swee Keat.

Our students joined their peers from other post-secondary institutions, such as the polytechnics, integrated programme (IP) and international schools at NUS to explore this year’s Seminar theme: “Singapore 4.0: What Next?” The theme directs the participants’ attention to the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the role of technology in shaping the future. Our students were given the chance to learn, envision and imagine the future of Singapore, a future that they will own and co-create. Their hard work culminated in an exhibition on the last day of the Seminar, where they proudly presented their projects to guests from the Ministry of Education as well as the staff and students from other institutions. The entire Seminar was closed by Minister of Education Mr Ong Ye Kung.

Our students shared that they learnt much through this whole experience: they relished the opportunity to discuss Singapore’s future, as well as the friendships they made with one another, and with their peers from other institutions.
