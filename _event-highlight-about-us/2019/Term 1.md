The aim of the run is to promote social bonding and healthy competition amongst students and staff of TMJC.  In preparation for TM Run, students were taught the concepts of pacing, effort judgement, as well as the varying types and intensities of running-related activities as part of a structured Physical Education programme at TMJC. Teaching and non-teaching staff members also participated in a Fun Run alongside their students.

It is clear from the smiling faces that the TMJC family had a great time together!

### JC1 CG Day- Bonding through VIA activities

8th March, a typical Friday, was not quite a typical school day for our JC1 students as they headed out of College in the morning, to the Tampines neighbourhood for newspaper collection fund-raising meant to help needy families in Tampines North.

The action did not stop there. Back in College in the afternoon, CGs had the opportunity to find out more about VIA opportunities through an interactive segment with various welfare organisations invited to College under the Community Awareness Programme.

What made CG day extra special was the red eggs making activity where students had a hand in dyeing eggs red and presenting them to their parents as a show of gratitude at the start of their JC journey, for their parents’ care and support in their growth.  
  
Through the day’s activities, we hope there was a knitting of hearts, be it amongst members of the same CG or between parent and child.

### JC1 Badge Pinning Ceremony

On 4 February, TMJC held our first Badge Pinning Ceremony for the JC1s who, in the last one month, have eased into the routine and rhythm of college life. Our JC2 students who are seniors in this journey, pinned the badges on for their juniors in a symbolic gesture of support and encouragement. Both cohorts will face different challenges this year but standing together as a unified TMJC student body, they will more than conquer the challenges that will come their way!

### Total Defence Day

On 19 February 2019, the pioneer JC1 cohort of Tampines Meridian Junior College (TMJC) embarked on a learning journey to Singapore Discovery Centre (SDC) in commemoration of Total Defence Day.

![](/images/2019-T1-Events-TotalDefenceDay_1.jpeg)

Through a special programme designed by the staff of TMJC and SDC, students learnt about the multi-dimensional nature of defence in Singapore. The programme sought to engage them by incorporating elements of experiential learning and friendly competition. Students participated in many hands-on activities where they learned more about the six pillars of Total Defence. Classes also competed among themselves in the ‘Amazing Race’ segment that focused on helping students understand the importance of Digital Defence in Singapore.

![](/images/2019-T1-Events-TotalDefenceDay_3.jpeg)

As this was the students’ first outing together as a class, they also forged deeper ties with one another as well as with their Civics Tutors by the end of the learning journey. It was a thoroughly enjoyable and enriching learning experience for all!

### Alumni Sharing at Orientation
![](/images/2019-T1-Events-AlumniSharing_1.jpeg)

On 12 February, the last day of Orientation, two of our recently graduated alumni from both our parent colleges – Jacelyn (MJC 17S303) and Ashlyn (TPJC17S09) – did a sharing on their JC journey with their juniors.The sharing was heartfelt and authentic, with them pointing out some key differences between the JC experience and the secondary school experience, and the challenges they faced along the way, such as managing their academics, CCA and Project Work responsibilities.  

  
Jacelyn and Ashlyn shared candidly that the JC journey might prove challenging, and advised their juniors to be ready to seek help from teachers, the college counsellors, and their friends when the going gets tough. At the same time, they also encouraged their juniors to be open to helping others out if their peers do approach them. Jacelyn and Ashlyn ended their sharing by reminding the freshmen to believe in themselves, and not to “measure \[their\] progress with someone else’s ruler”.

The College sincerely appreciates both alumni for taking time and the effort to share with their juniors. We look forward to more of our alumni coming back!
