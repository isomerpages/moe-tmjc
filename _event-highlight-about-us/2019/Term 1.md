The aim of the run is to promote social bonding and healthy competition amongst students and staff of TMJC.  In preparation for TM Run, students were taught the concepts of pacing, effort judgement, as well as the varying types and intensities of running-related activities as part of a structured Physical Education programme at TMJC. Teaching and non-teaching staff members also participated in a Fun Run alongside their students.

It is clear from the smiling faces that the TMJC family had a great time together!

### JC1 CG Day- Bonding through VIA activities

8th March, a typical Friday, was not quite a typical school day for our JC1 students as they headed out of College in the morning, to the Tampines neighbourhood for newspaper collection fund-raising meant to help needy families in Tampines North.

The action did not stop there. Back in College in the afternoon, CGs had the opportunity to find out more about VIA opportunities through an interactive segment with various welfare organisations invited to College under the Community Awareness Programme.

What made CG day extra special was the red eggs making activity where students had a hand in dyeing eggs red and presenting them to their parents as a show of gratitude at the start of their JC journey, for their parents’ care and support in their growth.  
  
Through the day’s activities, we hope there was a knitting of hearts, be it amongst members of the same CG or between parent and child.

The JC Experiential Programme provides the scholars who are about to begin their studies at SUTD with the opportunity to interact with our local students and gain an insight into our pre-university education system. The experience has also enriched both the lives of our local students and scholars through cross-cultural exchanges.

TMJC is glad to have had the opportunity to host the scholars and wishes them well as they move on to the next stage in their education journey.  

  

### JC1 Badge Pinning Ceremony

On 4 February, TMJC held our first Badge Pinning Ceremony for the JC1s who, in the last one month, have eased into the routine and rhythm of college life. Our JC2 students who are seniors in this journey, pinned the badges on for their juniors in a symbolic gesture of support and encouragement. Both cohorts will face different challenges this year but standing together as a unified TMJC student body, they will more than conquer the challenges that will come their way!

### Celebratory Lunch

It was an afternoon of special treats for our JC1 and JC2 students as the College came together to celebrate the effort and achievements of our recently graduated batch of students, who received their 2018 GCE A-Level results on 22 February 2019. Laughter and joyful chatter can be heard as students gather around the Pavilions relishing the treats and celebrating a shorter school day that day.

It has been an enriching and fruitful learning experience for our guitarists, as they put their hearts and minds into organizing and performing for the showcase. We are heartened by our students’ growth in this music journey, as most of them started off as beginners in playing the guitar.

The speaker, Dr Mohd Faizal Musa, provided the audience with profound insights into Malay Culture through his talk entitled ‘Bijaknya Budaya Melayu’. His speech encompassed different aspects of Malay Culture including its rich heritage in gastronomy as well as the nature and well-being of life.  
  
In the afternoon, the students from the three different MLEP centres gathered for the MLEP Orientation. Students were given the opportunity to interact with one another and have some fun while playing games prepared by the MLEP scholars.  JC2 TMJC MLEP students acted as facilitators for these activities and did their best to ensure that the students enjoyed the Orientation as a whole.
