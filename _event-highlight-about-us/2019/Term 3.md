### Teachers' Day Celebrations

![](/images/2019-T4-Events-TeachersDay_01.jpeg)
On 4th September, the entire TMJC family celebrated Teachers’ Day together. The morning began with a special concert organised by the student leaders specially for our teachers. The concert ended on a high note when our new teachers put together a surprise skit humourously depicting a day in school... . This was followed by class parties where civics groups showed their appreciation for their teachers. The morning was capped with a sumptuous buffet heart-warmingly prepared by the college’s support staff and our school leaders, with a total of 54 dishes! It was a great day where students, teachers and staff all had a great time bonding as one big TMJC family!   
 
  
### Project Kindness

“Project Kindness” was a student-initiated project led by a group of JC2 and JC1 students to show appreciation to all non-teaching staff as well our canteen, bookshop and photocopy shop vendors for their unwavering support for the students in their JC journey.  In this project, the student committee members together with the student body specially prepared personalised jars filled with appreciation messages and sweet treats for all the uncles and aunties to make their day.  The main highlight of this project was the breakfast reception prepared for all the support staff on 28 August.  During the reception, the student volunteers had meaningful interactions with the uncles and aunties and the gifts were also presented to all of them.  The support staff were moved by the gestures shown by the students and through this project, the students are also inspired to continue to show kindness to one another in their daily life.

On 8 August, TMJC marked another milestone as staff and students came together as one to celebrate Singapore’s 54th National Day. The theme was “Our Singapore”. In this year of Singapore’s Bicentennial, the celebrations traced the Singapore Story from past to present.

Singapore’s independence was symbolised by a special flag-raising ceremony that included a dignified march-in by a student Uniformed Group contingent. The College then proceeded to the Hall for a multi-sensorial concert that paid tribute to the contributions of Sir Stamford Raffles, the Founding Fathers of Independent Singapore and the Pioneer Generation, woven together by as a seamless narrative.

This was followed by the singing of a series of favourite National Songs, where staff and students belted out their love for Singapore in one loud voice.

Singapore’s multicultural food heritage is a common ground that unites all Singaporeans. The College thus decided to align this year’s Racial Harmony Day commemorative activities to Singapore’s 2019 UNESCO hawker culture bid. Last Friday on 19th July, the canteen featured all three food items present in Singapore's bid: Chendol, Chicken Rice and Briyani, plus an all-time favourite, Rojak. To simulate actual hawker culture, LIVE food stations were set up in the Multipurpose Hall; all staff and students were treated to free servings of Chendol and Rojak. To enhance the hawker food tasting experience, music videos that celebrate Singapore’s multicultural vibrancy were also played on loop. A jolly good time was had by all as the Multipurpose Hall was transformed into a community dining room where people of all races sat together to eat, talk and make merry.
