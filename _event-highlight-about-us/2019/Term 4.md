### Year-End Staff Planning 2019

On 5 December, the staff of TMJC got together for a year-end planning-cum-bonding session, culminating in a heart-warming dinner among colleagues and friends.

The day began with the Principal sharing the key messages from the MOE Schools Work Plan Seminar. This was followed by a special bonding activity where every staff member painted and personalised his or her own starfish, and pinned it on a customised board, to commemorate TMJC’s pioneer staff of 2019.

The day continued after lunch at Expo Convention Centre, where the Principal presented the 3-year strategy map for TMJC (2020-2022). This was followed by a World Cafe conversation where Middle Managers shared the 5 strategic thrusts and the strategy plan for 2020.

 The day ended on a high note with a dinner for staff and the College Advisory Committee (CAC) members, where staff gave gerberas to one another in appreciation and thanks. In addition, the MOE Outstanding Contribution Awards and the college’s Service Excellence Awards were presented to deserving winners.

 Three cheers to all TMJC staff for the hard work that was put in for 2019!
