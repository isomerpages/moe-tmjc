### Deepavali Celebration

Deepavali Celebration at TMJC kicked off with a broadcast production put together by Akash(22S207) and Bharathi Kannan(22S502) along with their team members from Tamil and Non-Tamil Indian Language students on the 20th of October which kicked off the mood for celebrations. The video production comprised of a travel vlog of our students exploring the sights and sounds of Little India during the festival of lights. Hindu teachers and staff also shared about their celebrations at home and the 10-minute broadcast ended off with an energetic Indian semi classical dance performance by our very own students Shakaanaa(22S501), Dhanyaa(22S501) and Aalia(22S305). Students from the Tamil Language Department along with Culture Promotion Club also put up beautiful decorations around the College to usher in the festival which fell on the 24th of October, 2022. This sparked off a festive mood in the midst of Project Work and A-Level Examinations preparations.  

The highlight of this year’s celebration was the Deepavali Bazaar organised by Tamil Language Students and Culture Promotion Club to raise funds to support Project Give, a community fundraising project by SINDA. Our students-initiated a VIA project to raise funds for students from needy families by selling Deepavali snacks, decorative items and setting up an activity corner to do Indian pottery painting. The bazaar which was held over two day 20th & 21st October, at the TM Cove raised a total of $367.00. The project leader Sruthi Rajesh(22S502) personally went down to hand over the funds to the Project Give booth set up at the Indian Heritage Centre. The students gesture to contribute towards the less fortunate during the festival season was commended by the chief executive officer of SINDA in a Facebook post on SINDAs official Facebook page. To round off the celebration, a gathering was arranged for Indian students on the 27th of October, when the staff and students were treated to a sumptuous lunch treat. Deepavali celebrations at TMJC was indeed a celebration of love, light and laughter.

### JC1 Higher Education and Career Fest

With the improving COVID-19 situation, the 2022 JC1 Higher Education and Career Fest received a facelift and was no longer confined to the virtual sphere.  
  
There were 3 parts to the Career Fest with the first part being a skills workshop on how to create an impactful impression during job interviews, “Impress at First Sight”, conducted by First Impressions Image International, a company specialising in personal branding and image management.  
  
The second part was a physical career fair in the hall. We are fortunate to have several organisations and institutions with us in this year’s fair and the students benefited greatly from interacting with the representatives.  
  
The Career Fest ended with industry talks by various working professionals from a wide range of industries.  
  
The College is thankful to the Raffles Rotary Club and our alumni for gracing the event as guest speakers. Their wealth of knowledge and life experiences provided a lot of insight to the students who seized the opportunity to ask questions. We hope that the Career Fest exposes the students to more higher education and industry landscape information to enable them to make informed decisions about their higher education choices as they progress beyond the A-Level.

### JC2 SG Perspectives - Engagement Session with Minister of State Ms Sun Xueling

On 28 September, our JC2 students had the unique opportunity to engage Minister of State (MOS) for Home Affairs, Social and Family Development, Ms Sun Xueling, in dialogue. The engagement session was part of the ‘SG Perspectives’ Programme which seeks to broaden students’ perspectives of how national issues affect them on a personal level. With the easing of Safe Management Measures, the session took place live in the College Hall.  
  
Through MOS Sun’s sharing, students were sensitised to the importance of safeguarding Singapore’s social mobility and ensuring one’s mental wellbeing. The students raised thoughtful questions that offered much food for thought in navigating the way ahead for Singapore in these areas of national significance.  
  
The College would like to thank MOS Sun for this most enriching session. The college would also like to thank the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Education (Character & Citizenship Education Branch) for co-organising this dialogue for the benefit of our students.
