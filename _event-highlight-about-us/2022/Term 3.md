### Teachers’ Day Celebration 2022

Teachers’ Day came early for TMJC on 26th August as we celebrated together as a College. This year’s theme, **_The Good Old Days_**, not only serves as a homage to our teachers and their youthful spirit, but also aptly describes our students’ school days that have been made more wonderful because of our teachers.  
  
Comprising two key segments, “Good morning, Class!” and “Thank you, Teacher!”, the celebration was thoughtfully planned with the hope that the collective experience shared that day would be remembered fondly by both teachers and students alike.  
  
“Good morning, Class!” - Cohort Celebration felt even more special this year after a two year hiatus. It included heartfelt performances put up by our talented students, our very own teacher Mr Wong Hoe Sing, and exciting games that kept everyone on their toes. The Teachers versus Students Dance Battle was certainly the highlight of this segment!  
  
“Thank you, Teacher!” – Civics Group (CG) Activities was a time for the CGs and our teachers to bond over competitive games and a timely opportunity for students to show their appreciation to their tutors in meaningful ways.  
Our celebration ended on a high note, with our Principal, Ms Yoong, and Vice-Principals, Mrs Pang, Mr Ang and Mr Tan, displaying their acting chops and gamely putting up a surprise performance. Indeed, it was a heart-warming and fun-filled morning that would be fondly remembered as part of our _good old days_.

As our students thanked their tutors for putting in the heart work into developing them on this special day, they also seized the opportunity to express their sincere gratitude to our non-teaching staff. They are our unsung heroes who have been working tirelessly behind the scenes to make TMJC a more conducive second home for learning.  
  
A big thank you to all teachers and non-teaching staff! Happy Teachers’ Day!
