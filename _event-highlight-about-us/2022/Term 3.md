### Teachers’ Day Celebration 2022

Teachers’ Day came early for TMJC on 26th August as we celebrated together as a College. This year’s theme, **_The Good Old Days_**, not only serves as a homage to our teachers and their youthful spirit, but also aptly describes our students’ school days that have been made more wonderful because of our teachers.  
  
Comprising two key segments, “Good morning, Class!” and “Thank you, Teacher!”, the celebration was thoughtfully planned with the hope that the collective experience shared that day would be remembered fondly by both teachers and students alike.  
  
“Good morning, Class!” - Cohort Celebration felt even more special this year after a two year hiatus. It included heartfelt performances put up by our talented students, our very own teacher Mr Wong Hoe Sing, and exciting games that kept everyone on their toes. The Teachers versus Students Dance Battle was certainly the highlight of this segment!  
  
“Thank you, Teacher!” – Civics Group (CG) Activities was a time for the CGs and our teachers to bond over competitive games and a timely opportunity for students to show their appreciation to their tutors in meaningful ways.  
Our celebration ended on a high note, with our Principal, Ms Yoong, and Vice-Principals, Mrs Pang, Mr Ang and Mr Tan, displaying their acting chops and gamely putting up a surprise performance. Indeed, it was a heart-warming and fun-filled morning that would be fondly remembered as part of our _good old days_.  
  
As our students thanked their tutors for putting in the heart work into developing them on this special day, they also seized the opportunity to express their sincere gratitude to our non-teaching staff. They are our unsung heroes who have been working tirelessly behind the scenes to make TMJC a more conducive second home for learning.  
  
A big thank you to all teachers and non-teaching staff! Happy Teachers’ Day!

### Social Mixing Initiative: TMJC MLEP & Poi Ching School

On 25 August, our TMJC Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) hosted students from Poi Ching School for a unique social mixing initiative.  

Our TMJC MLEP students took on the mantle of Cultural Ambassadors to share about the unique heritage and practices of the _tanjak,_ a Malay head apparel. The student-facilitated programme included sharing, quizzes, and a hands-on activity on the folding of the _tanjak._  

Social mixing aims to deepen students’ understanding of and sensitivity to other cultures. On top of providing opportunities for interactions between our students and peers of other races, the programme aims to allow students to interact with people from different segments of our community, and for this programme, our MLEP students were _kakak_ (big sisters) and _abang_ (big brothers) to the _mei-
mei_ (younger sisters) and _di-di_ (younger brothers) from Poi Ching School.

### Singapore Mathematical Society Essay Competition

This year, 3 TMJCians participated in the 2022 Singapore Mathematical Society (SMS) Essay Competition organised by the Singapore Mathematical Society.  
  
We are pleased to share that our students JORDON YEE (22S101), EUGENE LEE KANG RUI (22S101) and DAVID LAUW KWAI YONG (22S101) have achieved Honourable Mention for their essay.  
  
The Competition aims to expose students to various topics that are related to mathematics (such topics could be related to the history, application, or other aspects of mathematics) and to encourage articulation of mathematics through the exposition on these subjects.  
  
The competition theme for this year is on Mathematics and Environmental Sustainability, and our students’ essay titled “The Mathematics of Predicting Global Temperatures in 2050” used real life data to construct Mathematical Models using Best-Fit lines, Numerical Methods for approximations and Recurrence Relations to predict global temperature in the future.  
  
Our heartiest congratulations to our TMJCians!
