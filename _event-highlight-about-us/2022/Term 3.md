### Teachers’ Day Celebration 2022

Teachers’ Day came early for TMJC on 26th August as we celebrated together as a College. This year’s theme, **_The Good Old Days_**, not only serves as a homage to our teachers and their youthful spirit, but also aptly describes our students’ school days that have been made more wonderful because of our teachers.  
  
Comprising two key segments, “Good morning, Class!” and “Thank you, Teacher!”, the celebration was thoughtfully planned with the hope that the collective experience shared that day would be remembered fondly by both teachers and students alike.  
  
“Good morning, Class!” - Cohort Celebration felt even more special this year after a two year hiatus. It included heartfelt performances put up by our talented students, our very own teacher Mr Wong Hoe Sing, and exciting games that kept everyone on their toes. The Teachers versus Students Dance Battle was certainly the highlight of this segment!  
  
“Thank you, Teacher!” – Civics Group (CG) Activities was a time for the CGs and our teachers to bond over competitive games and a timely opportunity for students to show their appreciation to their tutors in meaningful ways.  
Our celebration ended on a high note, with our Principal, Ms Yoong, and Vice-Principals, Mrs Pang, Mr Ang and Mr Tan, displaying their acting chops and gamely putting up a surprise performance. Indeed, it was a heart-warming and fun-filled morning that would be fondly remembered as part of our _good old days_.  
  
As our students thanked their tutors for putting in the heart work into developing them on this special day, they also seized the opportunity to express their sincere gratitude to our non-teaching staff. They are our unsung heroes who have been working tirelessly behind the scenes to make TMJC a more conducive second home for learning.  
  
A big thank you to all teachers and non-teaching staff! Happy Teachers’ Day!

### Social Mixing Initiative: TMJC MLEP & Poi Ching School

On 25 August, our TMJC Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) hosted students from Poi Ching School for a unique social mixing initiative.  

Our TMJC MLEP students took on the mantle of Cultural Ambassadors to share about the unique heritage and practices of the _tanjak,_ a Malay head apparel. The student-facilitated programme included sharing, quizzes, and a hands-on activity on the folding of the _tanjak._  

Social mixing aims to deepen students’ understanding of and sensitivity to other cultures. On top of providing opportunities for interactions between our students and peers of other races, the programme aims to allow students to interact with people from different segments of our community, and for this programme, our MLEP students were _kakak_ (big sisters) and _abang_ (big brothers) to the _mei-
mei_ (younger sisters) and _di-di_ (younger brothers) from Poi Ching School.

### National Day cum TM Celebrates! 2022

On 8 August, TMJC celebrated her 4th birthday alongside Singapore's 57th! To mark this special day, the College put together a unique programme that was engaging and meaningful under the twin themes “Stronger Together, Majulah!” and “Be Better Together, United As ONE.”  
  
After the special National Day Observance Ceremony that included the band playing the National Anthem live for the first time and presentation of the National Day Awards that recognise our teachers’ contributions to the nation, our Principal, Ms Pamela Yoong unveiled Singapore’s largest Contact Lens Blisters mosaic, a highlight that entered into the Singapore Book of Records. After that, students participated in a variety of exciting interhouse classroom and outdoor games organised by the various CCAs. This was followed by the cohort breakfast CG bonding segment that featured a sumptuous menu of traditional breakfast items.  
The event ended on a high with the launch and officiation of TM Cove by Ms Yoong - a communal space for students to recharge and connect with their friends. What a way to end off our combined celebrations!  
  
Happy 57th Birthday Singapore! And Happy 4th Birthday TMJC!

### Fastest Fingers Graphing Calculator Competition (FFGCC) 2022

The 2022 inter-school Fastest Fingers Graphing Calculator Competition (FFGCC) is organised by TMJC and proudly sponsored by Texas Instruments. This year, 65 participants from 12 schools battled their way for a spot in the finals that was held on 3rd August 2022. Five schools (ACJC, DHS, NYJC, RI and TMJC) made it to the finals and we are proud to announce that the team from TMJC (comprising Nguyen Anh Duc from 21S101, Lee Hao from 21S101, Marcus Tan from 21S203 and Paulyne Santos Anthony from 21S203) came in 5th after putting up a tough fight.

![](/images/2022-T3-Events-FFGCC_01.jpg)

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the competition was held completely online in 2021. This year, with the easing of some safe management measures, we used a hybrid model in which participants joined us face-to-face while the audience and supporters watched a live broadcast.

![](/images/2022-T3-Events-FFGCC_02.jpg)

The Organising Committee have employed various ICT platforms to support this new format of the competition, without compromising the learning and integrity of competition. It received positive feedback from teachers and participants, and the event was a great success.

### L.O.V.E.3 Week

L.O.V.E.3 Week 2022, which stands for _Living Our Values Every Day, Everywhere, with Everyone_, took place this year from 25th to 29th July. L.O.V.E.3 Week is a week dedicated to celebrating the values that we believe in as an individual and as a TMJC family. Over the week, we aim to inspire students to live out our College values and allow them to develop strong moral reasoning capabilities through the discussion of moral dilemmas through a series of activities.  
  
The series of activities comprise of video interviews featuring members of the TMJC family and how they lived out our College values amidst the challenges, daily moral dilemma polls on Instagram to allow TMJC students to take a vote on their course of action, and a CCE lesson featuring different moral dilemmas for both JC1 and JC2 students. To encourage student voice, the JC1 students were also involved in a Video Competition, where each JC1 CG submitted a short 1-minute video, sharing about how they have been inspired by others who lived out admirable values.  
  
We were encouraged by the active participation in the daily moral dilemma instagram polls, as well as the creative entries submitted for the JC1 Video Competition, as TMJC students reflected on what our College values mean to them. In particular, the students were especially engaged in the CCE lesson, as they were introduced to different moral reasoning frameworks, took a poll on their course of action and engaged in tag-team debates with their peers. Through these activities, our students developed stronger self-awareness of the moral reasoning framework they tend to adopt and built empathy as they learnt to take on multiple perspectives.  
  
Most importantly, these discussions on moral dilemmas allowed our students to reflect on the ethical dimensions and implications of their choices, highlighting the importance of developing a strong moral compass.

### Racial Harmony Day (RHD) Commemoration

TMJC’s Racial Harmony Day (RHD) Commemoration this year spanned across several days from 19 to 22 July with the theme ‘Preserving Harmony in Singapore’s Multicultural Mosaic.’ The 2-part commemoration sought to help students navigate Singapore’s evolving multiculturalism.  
  
On 21 July, which is the actual day of commemoration, the College had the honour of hosting Second Minister for Education and Foreign Affairs, Dr. Maliki Osman as our Guest-of-Honour to join some of our classes for the commemoration activities.  
  
Firstly, students went through an in-house Citizenship Education (CE) Committee-facilitated RHD Interactive Gallery in the College Library. The Gallery featured personal stories of our TMJC teachers who lived through the turbulent 1960s. Our students also had the opportunity to deepen their personal conviction toward safeguarding Singapore’s fragile racial harmony. They were engaged digitally in an immersive independent Virtual Reality decision-making experience that featured reenactments of racist episodes that have made the news.  
  
Secondly, to promote student agency, our CG Chairpersons and Peer Support Leaders of the various classes facilitated discussions on Singapore’s race relations. The student-led discussions offered the participants varying perspectives and insights, as they respond to the questions and prompts that their CG had surfaced to the Tampines Meridian Student Council during the June holidays.  
  
Through these meaningful activities, we hope that our TMJC students will develop a renewed sense of purpose to protect Singapore’s multicultural harmony.

### Student Leaders' Investiture 2022

The Student Leaders’ Investiture is a significant ceremony held annually to recognise our newly elected JC1 Student Leaders, comprising CG Leaders (CG Chairpersons and Peer Support Leaders), CCA Leaders, and the Tampines Meridian Student Council (TMSC). The Investiture for the Class of 2023 took place on 20 July 2022, officially marking the start of their term in office.  

The theme for this year’s Investiture was **“Astron**”, which means **“star”** in Greek. It was chosen to be a reminder for all the Student Leaders that just as how stars provide guidance and light, the student leaders should similarly strive to be the “stars” – the role models – that guide and create meaningful experiences for their peers throughout their journey in TMJC.  

The ceremony began with the highly anticipated Student Leaders’ Walk-in, where the CCA leaders showcased their talents as they walked in, identifying themselves as each unique CCA group, while the CG Leaders and TMSC walked in according to their respective Houses, symbolising the strong House Spirit of TMJC. They warmly greeted with supportive cheers and applause from their peers and teachers.  

Our Principal, Ms Pamela Yoong, addressed the student leaders and shared inspiring words to encourage them on their leadership journey. Following that, the President of the 4th Tampines Meridian Student Council, El’yez Mu’raif (21A301), addressed the cohort of JC1 students and reflected on his journey as a Student Leader. The Badge Presentation Ceremony, which followed, was an important part of the Investiture, as student representatives were presented a badge by our Principal to identify themselves as Student Leaders and to officially mark the start of their leadership journey. In concluding the Investiture, our newly elected President of the 5th TMSC, Gerrard Poh (22S203), addressed the cohort and subsequently led all our TMJC Student Leaders in reciting the Leaders’ Oath.  

It was truly a momentous occasion witnessing the installation of the incoming batch of Student Leaders. We congratulate them once again and wish them a fruitful and meaningful leadership journey in TMJC!

### JC2 Higher Education Fest

As the COVID-19 situation takes a turn for the better and continues to do so, TMJC is finally able to invite our long term partners, the 6 local Autonomous Universities, down to the College for a sharing with our JC2 students.  
  
The JC2 Higher Education Fest took place across two weeks in July as NUS, NTU, SIT, SMU, SUSS, and SUTD gave brief introductions of themselves and talked about the exciting courses they offer to our students.  
  
Our JC2s were also given the opportunity to interact with the university representatives who set up booths after their sharing to address queries from our students.  
  
The College is grateful to the universities for their enthusiastic participation in our event and we hope that this event was able to motivate some of the students to work towards their goals as they enter the last phase of their preparation for the upcoming A-Level Examinations.

### TMJC x MOE President’s Challenge Heart Train Campaign 2022

As part of TMJC’s effort in giving back to our community, our staff welfare committee came together to organise a series of fundraising activities for staff to do our little part for the MOE President’s Challenge Heart Train Campaign 2022.  

  
One of the highlights included a breakfast session on 6 July 2022 where staff took a little break away from the Mid-Year Examination marking frenzy. Staff ordered Prata breakfast sets where proceeds from the sales were donated to the President’s Challenge Heart Train Campaign. It was great to see staff from different departments coming together, catching up over prata and conversations!

In addition, our staff also purchased DIY Bear Keychains kits to enjoy some family bonding time in creating their own unique keychains!
