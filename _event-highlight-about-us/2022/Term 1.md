<h3>TM Run 2022</h3>
<p>On the 10th of March 2022, TMJC held our TM Run. This year, it was organised
with the same format as 2021 but with the fresh inclusion of fringe activities
and a creative cheer competition which encouraged the innovative use of
banners, clappers, and pompoms initiated by the students. All the activities
were organised with adherence to safe management measures and were planned
in conjunction with our TMJC Student Councillors, who demonstrated a genuine
heart to lead and serve the College.</p>
<p>In preparation for TM Run, student competitors had been training diligently
during and outside of PE lessons, and fellow classmates rallied their support
by training alongside them as a form of camaraderie. In light of the logistical
needs of the event that had to prioritise safety and adherence to safe
distancing measures, students and staff readily volunteered to support
as first aiders, ushers, road marshals, registration and transition zone
referees, and helpers.</p>
<p>Our students demonstrated their passion and commitment to the College
as everyone played a vital role on that day. The TM Run competitors ran
earnestly as they represented their CG, the spectators presented and utilised
their handcrafted props to cheer their friends on and contributed to House
points by participating actively in the fringe activities. Albeit the unfavourable
weather conditions that brought the race to a premature end, the unforeseen
circumstance was incapable of dampening our spirits and instead strengthened
our College Spirit as a whole.</p>
<p>Indeed, TM Run is a testament to our College’s ability to improve and
shine through adversity as we strive “To Be Better Together, United as
One!”</p>

<h3>JC1 Gratitude in Action - Red Dyed Eggs Activity</h3>
<p>On 4th&nbsp;March, the JC1 students and their Civics Tutors had a great
time participating in the Gratitude in Action activity where the students
had a hand in dyeing eggs red to pack them into gift bags.</p>
<p>They also wrote thank you messages to their parents, to be included into
the gift bags. The students presented the red eggs and some traditional
cakes (kuehs) as a gift to their parents to show their gratitude at the
start of their JC journey, to thank their parents for their care and support
thus far.</p>
<p>We hope that the day’s activity provided the students with a good opportunity
to bond with their classmates and helped to bring the parents and their
children closer together.</p>

<h3>TM Connects 2022</h3>
<p>TM Connects, a community awareness event organised by the TMJC Values
In Action Committee, was carried out virtually on 4 March 2022 from 2.30pm
to 5pm through Zoom. The theme for TM Connects 2022 is “Opening Minds,
Impacting Lives”.</p>
<p>Through TM Connects, we hope students can gain awareness and have a better
understanding of different community issues, explore areas of interest
and choose the organisations that they would like to serve. Thereafter,
we hope TMJC students can seek to bring about positive change to the community.</p>
<p>We thank our partner organisations and students from selected JC2 CGs
and CCA who have come forward and shared enthusiastically with our JC1
students about service learning via a virtual platform during the session!</p>

<h3>Total Defence Day 2022</h3>
<p>TMJC commemorated Total Defence Day (TDD) from 15 February to 11 March
2022 under the theme “Together, We Keep Singapore Strong”. Introduced in
1984 to mark the day Singapore fell to Japanese troops in 1942, the annual
TDD Commemoration exhorts every Singaporean to play their part to keep
Singapore safe, secure and independent.</p>
<p>Amid Singapore’s transition towards COVID resilience, the significance
of the day becomes more pronounced. In light of this, during their Character
&amp; Citizenship Education lessons, students took perspective, discussed
what Total Defence meant to them and learnt about the role they can play
in Singapore’s national defence.&nbsp;The commemoration culminated in a
mural display outside the General Office, a collaboration between the Citizenship
Education Committee and the Art Unit. The Total Defence Mural functions
as a daily visual reminder to all TMJC students on the importance of being
united and adaptable in Singapore’s journey towards living with COVID.</p>

<h3>Badge Pinning Ceremony</h3>
<p>On 28 February 2022, the College held our annual Badge Pinning Ceremony.
The ceremony symbolises the journey taken together by the JC1s and JC2s
as they forge ahead as one TMJC student body.</p>
<p>During the ceremony, CG Chairpersons and Peer Support Leaders from each
JC2 class presented the College collar pins to their JC1 juniors to welcome
them to the TMJC family. The JC2 seniors were also given the opportunity
to share words of advice on what is truly essential in creating a memorable
and meaningful 2 years in TMJC. Having walked through the journey themselves,
the JC2 seniors’ words of advice left a great impact on their juniors.
The JC1s then proudly put on their College collar pins together, signifying
the official start of their wonderful and exciting journey ahead in TMJC.</p>

<h3>Tembusu Tree-Planting Ceremony 2022</h3>
<p>On 22nd&nbsp;February 2022, TMJC held our 3rd&nbsp;Tree-Planting Ceremony.
It represents a new beginning for the Class of 2021 as they graduate from
College, whilst leaving fond memories deeply etched to the grounds of the
College.
<br>This ceremony was led by Our School Leaders, Year Heads, together with
student representatives from the 3rd&nbsp;Tampines Meridian Student Council:&nbsp;
Ms Joanne Lin Min Hui (20S303 / President) and Mr Jves Tan (20S207 / Vice-President).</p>
<p>The Tembusu Tree-Planting Ceremony is a tradition TMJC started in 2020,
as it commemorates the shared experiences and achievements of each cohort
of students. The Tembusu Tree is chosen as it is a large, evergreen tree
that matures with stately beauty, and can provide shelter for all. It is
highly robust and can grow in almost any type of soil, testifying to its
resilience. Such attributes symbolise the values and character that the
College hopes to imbue in TMJC students.</p>

<h3>Staff Professional Development (PD) 2</h3>
<p>On the morning of 16 Feb 2022, our teachers came together for Staff PD
Time 2.</p>
<p>The focus for that morning was on Formative Assessments and comprised
of 2 parts:</p>
<p>Part 1 was a Zoom broadcast where our Instructional Mentors shared about
how teachers can use the Analysis of Student Work tool in understanding
where our students are and how we can move them to the next level.</p>
<p>During Part 2, our Teachers-Leaders, together with their 2021 Professional
Learning Team (PLT) members shared their team's progress and key learning
takeaways at the various breakout venues.</p>
<p>There were a total of 5 breakout sessions for our TMJC teachers to choose
from, namely, Growth Mindset, Differentiated Instructions, HOTWARE, Peer
feedback, and iGlow.</p>
<p>Our teachers were inspired by the passionate sharing and are ready to
try some of the strategies in their own classrooms!</p>

<h3>JC1 Orientation &amp; CCA Recruitment 2022</h3>
<p>On the 7th of February 2022, TMJC kicked off our JC1 Orientation, Voyage,
to receive our 5th batch of students. As our JC1s begin their JC journey,
Voyage hopes to take them beyond their academic pursuits and bond them
together, ready to embrace challenges as a team. The image of a ship setting
off on a journey, aims to evoke excitement and build teamwork amongst the
JC1s. In this journey, all staff and students will unite as a family to
overcome all obstacles.
<br>The first day saw a series of informative JC Curriculum Talk and a Dialogue
with School Leaders and Academic Heads that allowed students the opportunity
to get a better understanding of the academic demands and rigor of the
various disciplines. Students also enthusiastically visited the subject
booths to find out more about the different subjects offered in TMJC.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2022-T1-Events-JC1Orientation_01.jpeg">
</div>
<p>The subsequent days of Orientation shed light on the robust College Spirit
and vibrant student experiences here in TMJC. Dynamic House walk-in dances
that the OGLs had prepared for months to fervently receive our JC1s sparked
off the Day 2 activities. A series of icebreakers and bonding games were
curated to pave the way for new friendships. In addition, the OGLs took
on the roles as College Tour Ambassadors and enthusiastically introduced
our College venues and facilities to the JC1s.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2022-T1-Events-JC1Orientation_02.jpeg">
</div>
<p>On Day 3, the adventure continued as the JC1s partook in an exciting Scavenger
Hunt experience which taught the JC1s the significance of our College Anthem.
In addition, the JC1s were given the opportunity to warm up and dance as
they learnt the 2022 College Mass Dance choreographed to the song, “We’re
All In This Together”. This song was specially selected to induct the JC1s
into our TMJC family and reinforce the understanding that we will “Be Better
Together, United as One”.</p>

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2022-T1-Events-JC1Orientation_03.jpeg">
</div>
<p>On Day 4, the OGLs facilitated fun and enriching Internal Games that taught
our OGMs the importance of our College values. The JC1s experienced the
climax of Orientation as they watched the myriad of live Finale House and
CCA performances that were uniquely designed to inspire the JC1s with our
exuberant College Spirit. The OGLs also continued to model the way by encouraging
their juniors to innovate and upcycle used bottles and cans with environmental
sustainability as their motivation.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2022-T1-Events-JC1Orientation_04.jpeg">
</div>
<p>Day 5 brought the Orientation adventure to an exhilarating end as the
JC2 CCA Leaders’ inspired our juniors with the iconic CCA Leaders’ Walk-in
and Oath Taking Ceremony. The day ended with a meaningful JC1 CCA Recruitment
Exercise and CCA Booth Exhibition where our Performing Arts, Sports and
Games, and Clubs and Societies CCA Leaders shared with their juniors about
their heartfelt CCA life in TMJC, and the unique experiences their CCA
can offer, so as to help our JC1s to make an informed decision.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>All in all, our JC1s enjoyed Orientation, grew in character, and became
a part of the TMJC Family. Our JC2 OGLs also rose to the challenge of inducting
the JC1s in an innovative way amidst the challenging considerations to
keep the College family safe.</p>
<p>Welcome to TMJC once again, JC1s!</p>
<h3>Chinese New Year Celebrations with our International Scholars</h3>
<p>On 31 January 2022, as part of our TMJC CNY Celebrations, our 24 JC2 International
Scholars met our Principal, Ms Pamela Yoong, to exchange well wishes for
the Lunar New Year. During the session, Ms Yoong shared words of blessings
with them on behalf of the College. In return, our scholars shared hopes
for the College in line with the positive qualities of the Tiger.</p>
<p>This year, our Scholars were unable to return to their home countries
to celebrate the Lunar New Year with their families nor have their families
visit them in Singapore. As such, this made this occasion meaningful and
special for our Scholars as we celebrated with them as a TMJC family.</p>
<p>The College wishes our Scholars a Happy Lunar New Year!</p>

<h3>TMJC Chinese New Year Celebrations 2022</h3>
<p>As we enter the Lunar Year of the Tiger, our TMJC family celebrated the
annual Chinese New Year joyously on 31 January. Despite the ongoing pandemic,
our festive spirits were not dampened.</p>
<p>The celebration kicked off with a music performance by our very own Chinese
Orchestra, building a joyful atmosphere. This was followed by the screening
of two in-house productions:&nbsp; “虎&nbsp;and Huat is behind our Lunar
New Year traditions” by the Citizenship Education Student Committee and
“Our Lunar New Year traditions” by Talent Development students, revolving
around the theme of celebrating the rich cultural traditions of the Lunar
New Year, locally and in different Asian communities.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2022-T1-Events-CNYCelebrations_01_v2.jpeg">
</div>
<p>The second highlight of the celebration was the “Pawsome! Challenge”.
Each JC 2 civics group came together to complete a series of meaningful
activities related to the theme “Year of Courage and Strength”. Some of
the interesting tasks included: each class taking a new year well-wishes
video with their Civics Tutor, acting out their interpretation of the symbolic
characteristics of tiger, as well as using red packets to piece together
the Chinese character -&nbsp;虎&nbsp;(Tiger). The time spent together has
indeed bonded the class!</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2022-T1-Events-CNYCelebrations_02.jpeg">
</div>
<p>Our CCA groups, Guitar Ensemble, Choir, and Wushu also presented captivating
video performances of celebratory music, songs, and martial arts, heightening
the festive cheer. As part of Lunar New Year tradition, the student leaders
presented mandarin oranges to our school leaders, tutors and staff to express
gratitude and appreciation.</p>
<p>Our teachers also participated in the Inter-department CNY Challenge in
LT4 organised by our Staff Welfare Committee. Each department displayed
their creativity to complete the tasks, which included Lantern Making and
Spring Festival Couplet Making. The fun and laughter shared were truly
memorable.</p>

<p>The celebration ended on a high note, with our School Leaders pasting
4 Chinese characters “虎虎生威” (Forging ahead with the vigour and vitality
of the tiger) on the large colourful decal “TMJC celebrates CNY 2022”,
motivating TMJCians to embody courage and strength as they journey forward
in the year ahead.</p>

<h3>CCE Facilitation Skills Workshop for JC1 Teachers</h3>
<p>On 26 and 27 January 2022, TMJC conducted our very own in-house professional
development workshop, which focuses on sharpening our teachers’ facilitation
skills to create greater intellectual, affective, and experiential engagement
for our students in CCE lessons. During the workshop, teachers examined
how “Clarifying”, “Sensitising” and “Influencing” questions could be employed
to facilitate the discussions on contemporary issues with students. Thereafter,
teachers also had the opportunity to explore the use of the Context-Dimension
Frame to promote dialogic teaching in the classroom, with the aim to engage
our students in critical thinking and open discourse, and encourage active
participation through the sharing of multiple perspectives.</p>

</div>
<p>On 21 January 2022, TM Unite2, a cohort Values in Action (VIA) programme
for the JC2 students to unite together to serve and make a positive impact
on our community was carried out. The programme also provided opportunities
for some of the JC2 students to step forward to lead the cohort in this
VIA event.
<br>The theme for TM Unite2 this year was&nbsp;‘Reduce, Reuse &amp; Recycle
for a Greener Future’. This is in alignment with the Singapore Green Plan
where we hope that everyone can play a part to reduce carbon emissions,
keep our environment clean, and make saving resources and energy a way
of life in Singapore.&nbsp;Through a series of fun and engaging hands-on
activities related to environmental issues, students&nbsp;were able to
gain more experiential insights&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse,
and Recycle).&nbsp; Our JC2&nbsp;Civic Groups&nbsp;embarked on different
reuse projects to transform by-products and waste materials, from items
that are otherwise useless or unwanted, into functional products. These
upcycled products will be given&nbsp;to the&nbsp;beneficiaries&nbsp;at
AMKFSC Community Services. Through this&nbsp;programme, we hope to inspire
all TMJC students to be young stewards for the environment.</p>
