<h4>Shandong Experimental High School Visit</h4>
<p>We were excited to host a group of 50 students and 4 teachers from Shandong
Experimental High School (SEHS) for a one-day school immersion on 17 July
2024. The SEHS students had the opportunity to experience being a TMJC
student for the day as they attended lessons and activities with their
TMJC buddies. They ended their TMJC experience with cultural activity workshop
specially curated by our Cultural Promotion Club to introduce some aspects
of Singapore’s unique multi-culturalism. While the SEHS students interacted
with their buddies, their teachers had rich interactions and professional
exchanges with TMJC teachers as we shared and learnt from each other. All
in all, it was a day of meaningful learning and new friendships built for
all involved. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>JC2 SG Perspectives Dialogue on ‘The Future of Work’&nbsp;</h4>
<p>On 5 July, our JC2 students had the invaluable opportunity to hear from
Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Minister for Trade and Industry Mr Gan
Kim Yong on ‘The Future of Work’. His visit is part of the SG Perspectives
initiative that seeks to broaden student perspectives on the wide-ranging
impact of national issues. Students learnt about the importance of lifelong
learning in order to thrive in a dynamic and ever-changing work landscape
characterised by geopolitical contestation, the green transition and artificial
intelligence. Our students also engaged him in a robust discussion on topics
such as the future of the finance industry in Singapore, the unique role
Singapore plays in trade negotiations, and the need for international collaboration
to achieve better outcomes amid current US-China trade tensions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The college would like to thank DPM Gan for this most enriching session.
The college would also like to thank the Ministry of Trade and Industry
and the Ministry of Education (Character &amp; Citizenship Education Branch)
for co-organising this dialogue for the benefit of our students.</p>
