#### Visit by Shandong Experimental High School

In 2019, representatives from our College had the opportunity to visit Shandong Experimental High School (SEHS). This year, after a hiatus of three years due to the pandemic, we have the privilege of hosting a group of 39 students and 4 teachers from SEHS for a school immersion programme on 20 and 21 July. During their stay with us, SEHS students were each paired with a local buddy as they experienced what it was like to be a TMJC student as they participated various learning and co-curricular activities with their new friends. SEHS teachers stepped into our classrooms to observe how our lessons were conducted and had conversations with our staff to promote mutual professional learning and development. We look forward to our continued partnership with SEHS in the years to come.

#### National Gallery of Singapore's Roving Art Truck

We are excited to have the National Gallery of Singapore’s (NSG) Roving Art Truck come to TMJC! The Roving Art Truck is a unique art programme on wheels that travels to schools across Singapore as part of NSG’s education and outreach efforts. Staff and students learnt about artistic techniques and material through a “Look, Imagine and Tell Stories!” feature wall which featured 10 artworks from the National Collection by prominent Singaporean and Southeast Asian artists, including Liu Kang, Chua Mia Tee and Hernando R Ocampo. Visitors also learnt about the elements of art through a “Seven Elements of Art” infographic wall. Finally, at the “ARTiculate Your Thoughts” interactive wall, which recreated the artwork, “The Net: Most Definitely The Singapore River,” visitors had the opportunity to pen their thoughts and messages about sustainability on cut outs before hanging them on the net. In all, the Roving Art Truck was an educational and inspirational experience as we took some time out for art appreciation and art therapy.
