#### Singapore-Industry Scholarship (SgIS) Award Ceremony 2023

The Singapore-Industry Scholarship (SgIS) Award Ceremony 2023 was held on 17 August 2023 with the Second Minister for Education, Dr Maliki Osman, as the Guest of Honour.

Launched in 2012, the SgIS aims to nurture a core of Singaporean industry leaders to steer the development of the country’s key strategic industries. It is the only scholarship offered in partnership between the Government and local industries. SgIS has established itself as one of the choice scholarships in Singapore, with 119 Sponsoring Organisations (SOs) this year. The 119 SOs come from 15 key sectors, including biomedical and pharmaceuticals, electronics, engineering, lifestyle and food, and social services. Since its inception, the SgIS has awarded scholarships to more than 1,400 recipients.

TMJC is proud to share that we have 8 recipients of the SgIS Mid-Term Scholarships this year:

#### TM Celebrates! 

8 August marks a day of double celebrations for TMJC! On this special day, the College commemorated both Singapore’s 58th birthday as well as TMJC’s 5th birthday. Both students and staff enjoyed a unique and memorable programme with the theme ‘TM Onward’, which ties in with this year’s National Day theme - ‘Onward As One’. ‘TM Onward’ represents how TMJCians need to have unity, resilience and be forward-looking to continue to make TM home for all.

The day started off with the National Day Observance Ceremony with TMJC Band playing the National Anthem live. Adding on to the celebration, TMJC launched our very own TMJC mascot - Skye the Red Panda. Student and staff also received a keychain in the shape of our TMJC mascot, in the hope that the keychain will hold the key to unlock TMJCians’ goals as they aim for the sky. To make this year’s celebration even more unforgettable, our students, teachers and non-teaching staff assembled to form ‘TM5’, symbolising how everyone makes up one united TMJC. 

The next segment of the celebration saw students and staff participating in a variety of exciting interhouse classroom and outdoor activities organised by our CCA and CG leaders. To add on to the festivities, external food vendors were engaged to distribute sumptuous carnival and local delights like popcorn, muah chee, churros and many more. In fact, this is the first year that both cohorts came together to enjoy our TMJC Games Carnival together!

Finally, the celebration culminated with both cohorts gathering together in the College Hall for the first time for a concert cum mass singalong session. There were special performances put up by CCA groups, individual student groups and even a teacher. The event ended on a high with our Principal, Mr Sin, leading the entire College in a mass singalong to the song ‘Count on Me, Singapore’. What an eventful way to end off the double celebrations!

#### General Paper External Agencies Outreach Programme

On the 16th of August 2023, TMJC hosted Senior Parliamentary Secretary (SPS) Rahayu Mahzam for the General Paper External Agencies Outreach Programme, an annual programme to provide Pre-University students with a breadth of views and insight into Singapore issues from the perspective of public service agencies. The engagement session saw SPS share with JC2 students more about Singapore’s principles of governance, as well as Singapore’s tough stance on drugs and its use of the death penalty. Students asked SPS questions ranging from whether she thought there were sufficient provisions in place for working mothers in Singapore, to other issues of concern to youth today. It was an enriching and meaningful session for everyone.

#### 2023 Inter-School Graphing Calculator Grand Prix

TMJC is proud to have organised the 2023 Inter-school Graphing Calculator (GC) Grand Prix. This year, 60 participants from 11 schools battled their way for a spot in the finals that was held on 2nd August 2023. Five schools (ACJC, DHS, HCI, TMJC and TJC) made it to the finals and we are happy to announce that the team from TMJC (comprising Lim Yu Shen 22S101, Ivan Lau Xu Yang 22S101, Le Hai Long Quan 22S101 and Tejapu Lokesh Sai Kumar 22S208) came in 5th after putting up a good fight. Congratulations to Team TMJC for their effort and outstanding performance!
 
This year, with the relaxation of safe management measures, the competition was conducted on-site with a live audience. The audience round got students excited and they enthusiastically solved the Math questions. To further enhance our students' thinking and problem-solving skills, a new round was introduced in which the finalists use the GC as a computational tool to analyse authentic real-world problems and offer potential solutions and insights. For this round, we invited esteemed academic experts Dr Hang Kim Hoo, STEM Education Programme Manager and Ms June Tan, Lead Curriculum Specialist to preside as judges. Dr Hang also shared his expert insights and observations which greatly enriched the students’ learning.  The event was a success and received extremely positive responses from teachers and participants.

#### Harvard GlobalWE Annual Essay Contest 2023

Earlier this year, a group of 7 students from our College participated in the Harvard GlobalWE Annual Essay Contest 2023. 

Harvard GlobalWE is a shared interest group of the Harvard Alumni Association. They are dedicated to the empowerment of women through education, dialogue, and connection among individuals working for women’s rights and freedoms worldwide.

The GlobalWE Essay Contest was established to invite students to think critically about the status and rights of women. The entries were judged based on how well they identify the chosen challenge, explain the problems, convey ideas with emotional power, and identify potential solutions. Essays were also judged on focus, content, organisation, accuracy, language use, vocabulary, and style. The essay question for this year’s competition was “What is the biggest challenge facing women and girls in your country today?”

There were a total of 6 winners from Singapore and we are proud to announce that one of our students was selected as a winner and three of our students received an Honourable Mention.

#### Tampines Meridian Student Leaders’ Investiture

The 6th Tampines Meridian Student Leaders’ Investiture (SLI) was held on Wednesday, 19 July 2023. The SLI is a significant ceremony held annually to recognise our newly elected JC1 Student Leaders, comprising Civics Group Leaders (CG Chairpersons and Peer Support Leaders), CCA Leaders, and the Tampines Meridian Student Council (TMSC). This year, we had the privilege of having distinguished guests from other Colleges with us to witness the installation of our 6th batch of Student Leaders.

The theme for this year’s Investiture was “Light the Way”. As everyone goes through challenges during their JC journey, they would look for a beacon of light to follow. Our student leaders thus aspire to be the beacons of light, modelling the way and leading their peers, while creating meaningful experiences for them throughout their journey in TMJC.

The highlight of the Investiture was the highly anticipated and energetic Student Leaders’ Walk-in. This saw our CCA leaders showcase their talents as they identified themselves as each unique CCA group, while our CG Leaders and TMSC showcased the strong House Spirit in TMJC as they walked in according to their respective Houses. Cheers and applause filled the College Hall as the leaders walked in proudly to represent their respective leadership groups.

Our Principal, Mr Sin Kim Ho, addressed the student leaders and shared inspiring words to encourage them as they embarked on their leadership journey. Following that, the Vice-President of the 5th TMSC, Goh Yan Ting (22S503), represented the outgoing batch of student leaders and addressed the cohort of JC1 students, while reflecting on her journey as a student leader. Several other JC2 student leaders also shared their words of advice through a meaningful video. The Badge Presentation Ceremony which followed saw our student representatives being presented a badge by our School Leaders to identify themselves as student leaders and to officially mark the start of their leadership journey. Finally, our newly elected President of the 6th TMSC, Samara Marguerita Joseph (23A201), addressed the cohort and subsequently led all student leaders in reciting the Leaders’ Oath.

The SLI was truly a momentous occasion witnessed by the entire cohort of JC1 students, all staff, and distinguished guests from various Colleges. We congratulate the newly elected student leaders once again and wish them a fruitful and meaningful leadership journey in TMJC!

#### Visit by Shandong Experimental High School

In 2019, representatives from our College had the opportunity to visit Shandong Experimental High School (SEHS). This year, after a hiatus of three years due to the pandemic, we have the privilege of hosting a group of 39 students and 4 teachers from SEHS for a school immersion programme on 20 and 21 July. During their stay with us, SEHS students were each paired with a local buddy as they experienced what it was like to be a TMJC student as they participated various learning and co-curricular activities with their new friends. SEHS teachers stepped into our classrooms to observe how our lessons were conducted and had conversations with our staff to promote mutual professional learning and development.

#### National Gallery of Singapore's Roving Art Truck

We are excited to have the National Gallery of Singapore’s (NSG) Roving Art Truck come to TMJC! The Roving Art Truck is a unique art programme on wheels that travels to schools across Singapore as part of NSG’s education and outreach efforts. Staff and students learnt about artistic techniques and material through a “Look, Imagine and Tell Stories!” feature wall which featured 10 artworks from the National Collection by prominent Singaporean and Southeast Asian artists, including Liu Kang, Chua Mia Tee and Hernando R Ocampo. Visitors also learnt about the elements of art through a “Seven Elements of Art” infographic wall. Finally, at the “ARTiculate Your Thoughts” interactive wall, which recreated the artwork, “The Net: Most Definitely The Singapore River,” visitors had the opportunity to pen their thoughts and messages about sustainability on cut outs before hanging them on the net. In all, the Roving Art Truck was an educational and inspirational experience as we took some time out for art appreciation and art therapy.
