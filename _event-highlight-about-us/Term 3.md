<h3>JC1 SG Perspectives - Ministry of Foreign Affairs Engagement Session</h3>
<p>On 3 July, our JC1 students had the unique opportunity to engage Ambassador
Mr Lim Thuan Kuan, in dialogue. The Ambassador’s engagement session was
part of the ‘SG Perspectives’ Programme which seeks to broaden students’
perspectives of Singapore’s foreign policy and how it affects them.
<br>
<br>Through Ambassador Lim’s sharing, students were sensitised to the key
principles of Singapore’s foreign policy and her persistent vulnerabilities
as a small country. They also learnt about how foreign policy impacts their
lives. Finally, our students engaged him in a robust Q&amp;A session on
contemporary issues that impact Singapore—such as the ongoing Israel-Hamas
conflict and US-China tensions.</p>
<p>The college would like to thank Ambassador Lim for this most enriching
session. The college would also like to thank the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and the Ministry of Education (Character &amp; Citizenship Education Branch)
for co-organising this dialogue for the benefit of our students.</p>
