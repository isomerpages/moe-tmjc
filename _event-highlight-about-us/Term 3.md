<h3>Tampines Meridian Student Leaders' Investiture 2025</h3>
<p>On 31st July 2025, we concluded our 8th Tampines Meridian Student Leaders'
Investiture 2025, where we celebrate our newly invested Student Leaders
taking a bold step forward in their leadership journey.
<br>
<br>Themed Crescita, this year’s Student Leaders’ Investiture emphasised the
spirit of growth. This investiture saw our CCA Leaders, CG Leaders and
Student Councillors come together with pride and purpose ready to grow,
lead, and uplift one another as one united TMJC family!
<br>
<br>The event began with an energetic walk-in by the Student Leaders. CCA
Leaders showcased their group identities, while CG Leaders and the TMSC
entered by Houses, reflecting TMJC’s strong House spirit. Our Principal,
Mr Sin, delivered an inspiring speech, encouraging the leaders as they
began their journey. Outgoing President of the 7th TMSC, Akram Syahid,
reflected on his leadership experience next, and offered heartfelt advice
to the new cohort. The Badge Presentation Ceremony which followed saw our
student representatives being presented a badge by our School Leaders to
identify themselves as student leaders and to officially mark the start
of their leadership journey. The event concluded with a speech by Felicia
Raman, the new President of the 8th TMSC, who led all leaders in reciting
the Leaders’ Oath.
<br>
<br>As their leadership journey begins, we look forward to seeing our student
leaders grow in strength, character, and unity — inspiring change and making
a difference together as one TMJC leadership body.</p>

<h4>Project Care + L.O.V.E 3 Week</h4>
<p>L.O.V.E Week is a week dedicated to celebrating the values that we believe
in as an individual and as a TMJC family. Over the week, we aim to inspire
students to live out our College values and allow them to develop strong
moral reasoning capabilities through the discussion of moral dilemmas through
a series of activities.
<br>
<br>This year marks the inaugural collaboration between the Student Management
and Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Committees for Project Care
x L.O.V.E Week 2025! This event spanned across 3 weeks in Term 3 (Weeks
5 – 7), with our very own JC1 CG Chairpersons and PSLs coming together
to streamline College activities and bring a more holistic experience to
the student population.
<br>
<br>The overarching theme for Project Care x L.O.V.E Week 2025 is B-Eats of
Appreciation, with a different theme each week to motivate our students
to reflect on their values, appreciate others and enhance their overall
well-being. This event kickstarted with the theme of <em>Authenticity through Reflection - Who are you when no one is watching?</em>
<br>
<br>The series of activities comprise of live sharings by members of the TMJC
family and how they lived out their values amidst the challenges, reflections
of values through student stories at the L.O.V.E Week Board, a personal
pledge at the Mirror Board to live out those values, and a CCE lesson featuring
different moral dilemmas for both JC1 and JC2 students. To encourage student
engagement, a series of activities were lined up for the students at the
TM Cove each week, starting with a bracelet making workshop where students
are invited to create unique bracelets featuring values they hold dear.
A photobooth was also set up for students to take photos with their peers.
<br>
<br>We were encouraged by the active participation at the workshops and the
enthusiastic posting of personal pledges by students. In particular, the
students were especially engaged in the CCE lesson, as they were introduced
to different moral reasoning frameworks, took a poll on their course of
action and engaged in tag-team debates with their peers. Through these
activities, our students developed stronger self-awareness of the moral
reasoning framework they tend to adopt and built empathy as they learnt
to take on multiple perspectives.
<br>
<br>Most importantly, these discussions on moral dilemmas allowed our students
to reflect on the ethical dimensions and implications of their choices,
highlighting the importance of developing a strong moral compass.</p>

<h3>TM GC Challenge 2025</h3>
<p>Held from 22 to 30 July 2025, the <strong>TM GC Challenge</strong> brought
together TMJC students in an exciting showcase of mathematical thinking
and teamwork. JC1 students battled it out in an <strong>intra-class competition</strong>,
applying graphing calculator (GC) skills to tackle A Level exam-type problems
independently. Meanwhile, JC2 students engaged in an <strong>inter-house challenge</strong> during
Math lecture, followed by meaningful group discussions to solve authentic,
data-driven problems.</p>
<p>The <strong>TM GC Challenge</strong> not only enhanced students’ GC competencies
and appreciation of math in real-life contexts, but also encouraged <strong>independent learning</strong>, <strong>collaborative problem-solving</strong>,
and <strong>effective communication</strong>.</p>

<h3>Racial Harmony Day 2025</h3>
<p>In collaboration with the Student Leadership Development Team and Culture
Promotion Club that comprise the Student Organising Committee, the college
commemorated Racial Harmony Day (RHD) 2025 from 21 July to 31 July. The
theme for this year’s Racial Harmony Day (RHD) Commemoration is '<em>Our People, Our Tapestry</em>'
and the focus was on building bridges to preserve Singapore’s Multicultural
Heritage. This was done through a 3-part commemoration:
<br>
<br>Part 1 involved a whole-school sharing by members of the Student Organising
Committee on the significance of Singapore’s Multicultural Culinary Heritage.
They shared personal recollections on the transformative and unifying power
of food. Part 2 helped students gain a closer look at race through student-driven
reflective CCE lessons to deepen cross-cultural knowledge and skills in
students. The JC1 CG Leaders applied facilitation skills learnt during
the RHD CG Leaders Facilitation Workshop to facilitate CCE class discussions
on race-based issues. Meanwhile, through game-based learning, JC2 students
deepened their multicultural understanding and respect of their own and
others’ cultural experiences, practices and perspectives.
<br>
<br>Finally, Part 3 encompassed experiential food tasting in the canteen to
reinforce love for Singapore’s multicultural cuisine, alongside curated
videos by members of the Culture Promotion Club. Free (on a first-come,
first-served basis) “Singapore Rojak” that symbolises Singapore’s racial
harmony was served, alongside other multicultural iconic delicacies like
Nonya kueh and Roti Prata. A bonus this year is the SG60 RHD Whole College
Activity which will feature food review recommendations of all 60 CGs (JC1s
and JC2s). Their submissions, 1 per CG, will be compiled into a food guide
that will be disseminated to all later this year.</p>

<h3>TM Run 2025</h3>
<p>TMJC’s very first college event of the new semester took place on 16 July
2025 at Bedok Reservoir Park. This event aimed to promote physical activity,
social bonding and healthy competition amongst students and staff of TMJC.
TM Run 2025 consisted of a 3.8-km competitive race, a 2.4-km mass run/walk
and Inter-House cheer competition. The route took participants along the
scenic loop of Bedok Reservoir, ending at the PAssion Wave Bedok Reservoir
building. The competitive race pitted the speed and endurance of individuals
against one another, while the 2.4-km mass run ended with a celebration
of friendship and camaraderie. Some of our staff also competed in the staff
race, or participated in the mass run with their students. In preparation
for TM Run as a culminating event, students were taught the concepts of
pacing, effort judgment, as well as the varying types and intensities of
running-related activities as part of a well-structured Physical Education
programme at TMJC.</p>

<h3>Shandong Experimental High School Visit</h3>
<p>We were excited to host a group of 60 students and 4 teachers from Shandong
Experimental High School (SEHS) for a one-day school immersion on 17 July
2025. The SEHS students had the opportunity to experience being a TMJC
student for the day as they attended lessons and activities with their
TMJC buddies. They ended their TMJC experience with a cultural activity
workshop specially curated by our Cultural Promotion Club to introduce
some aspects of Singapore’s unique multi-culturalism. While the SEHS students
interacted with their buddies, their teachers had rich interactions and
professional exchanges with TMJC teachers as we shared and learnt from
each other. All in all, it was a day of meaningful learning and new friendships
built for all involved.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>JC1 SG Perspectives - Ministry of Foreign Affairs Engagement Session</h3>
<p>On 3 July, our JC1 students had the unique opportunity to engage Ambassador
Mr Lim Thuan Kuan, in dialogue. The Ambassador’s engagement session was
part of the ‘SG Perspectives’ Programme which seeks to broaden students’
perspectives of Singapore’s foreign policy and how it affects them.
<br>
<br>Through Ambassador Lim’s sharing, students were sensitised to the key
principles of Singapore’s foreign policy and her persistent vulnerabilities
as a small country. They also learnt about how foreign policy impacts their
lives. Finally, our students engaged him in a robust Q&amp;A session on
contemporary issues that impact Singapore—such as the ongoing Israel-Hamas
conflict and US-China tensions.
<br>
<br>The college would like to thank Ambassador Lim for this most enriching
session. The college would also like to thank the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and the Ministry of Education (Character &amp; Citizenship Education Branch)
for co-organising this dialogue for the benefit of our students.</p>
