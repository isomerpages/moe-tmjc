<h4>TMJC X CAG</h4>
<p>On the 2nd and 10th of August 2024, a group of students from Tampines
Meridian Football Girls and Taekwondo CCA had the privilege of joining
employees from Changi Airport Group for an amazing volunteering experience
to support all the athletes participating in the 2024 Olympics.
<br>
<br>Our students curated a set of football and taekwondo-related questions
to engage with visitors in the transit areas of Terminals 1 and 2. The
taekwondo team also put up a series of amazing showcases, delighting the
visitors. Following this, we captured moments through group photos to demonstrate
our unwavering support for the athletes in the Olympics and to convey heartfelt
well-wishes for Singapore's 59th Birthday.
<br>
<br>It was truly heartening to witness the establishment of friendships among
our local and global friends, transcending language barriers through interactive
games and quizzes at Changi Airport. This experience authentically reflects
the warmth and inclusivity of our community, creating a truly unforgettable
Changi Experience.

<h4>National Day Celebrations and TM Celebrates! 2024</h4>
<p>8 August marked a day of double happiness for TMJC. On this special day,
our College commemorated Singapore’s 59th birthday and celebrated our College’s
6th birthday alongside staff and students from CPAS. Students and staff
were treated to a morning filled with fun and learning with the theme ‘Together,
As One United People’.
<br>
<br>Part 1 of the day’s event commemorated the strength of the nation through
a special flag-raising ceremony that symbolised Singapore’s independence.
The dignified march-in by the 7th TMSC Exco was complemented by a rousing
rendition of the National Anthem played live by the Band.
<br>
<br>Part 2 of the event celebrated the vitality of college life through exciting
carnival and traditional games organised by the CGs and CCAs. To enhance
the festive mood, external food vendors were engaged to dispense traditional
local and international snack items like rainbow ice cream, muah chee and
churros.
<br>
<br>Finally, Part 3 saw the joyous culmination of the event where the College
came together as one in the hall for a series of special CCA performances
and video montages that reflected National and College values such as resilience
and harmony. The event ended on a high with an impassioned National Day
Song sing-along segment and a dynamic balloon drop, where balloons containing
the hopes and dreams TMJCians penned for Singapore were released. What
a memorable way to end the day's celebrations!</p>

<h4>2024 Inter-school Graphing Calculator (GC) Grand Prix</h4>
<p>The 2024 Inter-school Graphing Calculator (GC) Grand Prix is organised
by TMJC and proudly sponsored by Texas Instruments. This year, 57 participants
from 10 schools battled their way for a spot in the finals that was held
on 31st July 2024. Team TMJC (comprising Nguyen Mai Thanh 23S101, Ho Bing
Xuan 23S101, He JingZhi 23S101 and Tan Weijia, Jaeden 23S101) was one of
five schools that made it to the final round of the competition. Congratulations
to Team TMJC for their outstanding performance!
<br>
<br>Like last year, this year’s competition was conducted on-site with a live
audience. The Audience Round got students excited, and they enthusiastically
solved the Mathematics questions to win attractive prizes. To further enhance
our students' thinking and problem-solving skills, one of the highlights
was the Second Round, in which the finalists used the GC as a computational
tool to analyse an authentic real-world problem and offer potential solutions
and insights. For this round, we invited esteemed academic experts Dr Hang
Kim Hoo (STEM Education Programme Manager, Curriculum Planning &amp; Development
Division - Singapore), Assoc Prof Toh Pee Choon (Deputy Head of Mathematics
and Mathematics Education, National Institute of Education) and Mr Yuen
Wen Jun (Curriculum Resource Development Officer, Curriculum Planning &amp;
Development Division - Singapore) to preside as judges. Dr Hang also shared
his expert insights and observations which greatly enriched the students’
learning. The event was a success and received extremely positive responses
from teachers and participants.</p>

<h4>CG Leaders - Celebration of Learning</h4>
<p>On 24th July, TMJC held our inaugural Celebration of Learning for JC2
Civics Group (CG) Chairpersons and Peer Support Leaders. Specially organised
for our JC2 CG Leaders, this event saw CG Leaders coming together to celebrate
their leadership journey in TMJC and expressing gratitude for those who
have journeyed with them through the ups and downs.
<br>
<br>These CG Leaders certainly deserve recognition for their tireless effort
as they often work behind the scenes, encourage their peers and provide
support to others while juggling their own heavy commitments. While their
leadership journey in TMJC may be coming to an end, the wonderful memories
and lessons learnt will surely stay with them for a long time.
<br>
<br>May their growth as a CG leader mark the beginning of yet another chapter
of inspiring leadership and meaningful learning. Wishing you all the best,
6th TMJC Civics Group Leaders!</p>

<h4>Student Leaders’ Investiture 2024</h4>
<p>Student Leaders’ Investiture, held on 18 July, was a significant ceremony
to recognise our newly elected 7th TMJC Student Leaders, comprising Civics
Group Leaders (CG Chairpersons and Peer Support Leaders), CCA Leaders,
and Tampines Meridian Student Council (TMSC).
<br>
<br>The theme for this year’s Investiture is “Aspiring Constellations”. “Aspiring”
evokes the pursuit of grand dreams, embodying the vision and commitment
to excellence that TMJC student leaders aspire to. “Constellations” serve
as a powerful symbol of the boundless possibilities and challenges that
TMJC student leaders confront with a courageous attitude.
<br>
<br>The ceremony began with the highly anticipated and energetic Student Leaders’
Walk-in, followed by an opening address by our Principal, Mr Sin, to encourage
our student leaders as they embark on their leadership journey. Thereafter,
a video montage depicting the fulfilling times which the student leaders
had thus far was shown, followed by speeches from the 6th Tampines Meridian
Student Council President, Samara Marguerita Joseph (23A201), and the 7th
Tampines Meridian Student Council President, Akram Syahid Bin Salim (24S203).
The Badge-presentation and Oath-taking ceremony followed thereafter, symbolising
the start of our student leaders’ leadership journeys.
<br>
<br>We congratulate the newly elected student leaders and may they arise like
new stars in the skies, illuminating the journey ahead for their peers
in TMJC.</p>

<h4>Racial Harmony Day (RHD) Commemoration 2024</h4>
<p>Racial Harmony Day (RHD) Commemoration this year spanned 22 to 29 July
with the theme ‘Preserving Harmony in Singapore’s Multicultural Mosaic.’
The 2-part student-driven commemoration sought to help students build bridges
to preserve Singapore’s Multicultural Heritage.
<br>
<br>First, through dialogic learning, JC1 CG Leaders applied the dialogue
facilitation skills learnt during the CG Leaders Training Workshop to facilitate&nbsp;race-related
questions from the cohort in their classes. Meanwhile, the JC2s underwent
game-based learning to deepen their multicultural understanding and respect
of their own and others’ cultural experiences, practices and perspectives.
<br>
<br>Second, CG leaders of both levels applied their gallery facilitation skills
gleaned from their training to facilitate experiential sense-making among
their peers via the RHD Interactive Gallery Experience at the Library.
Through this experience, students learnt the ups and downs of Singapore’s
multicultural journey. A highlight is the segment featuring personal stories
from former TMJC teachers who experienced first-hand the racial riots of
the 1960s.
<br>
<br>Through these activities, we hope that our students will develop a renewed
sense of purpose to protect Singapore’s multicultural harmony.</p>

<h4>Shandong Experimental High School Visit</h4>
<p>We were excited to host a group of 50 students and 4 teachers from Shandong
Experimental High School (SEHS) for a one-day school immersion on 17 July
2024. The SEHS students had the opportunity to experience being a TMJC
student for the day as they attended lessons and activities with their
TMJC buddies. They ended their TMJC experience with cultural activity workshop
specially curated by our Cultural Promotion Club to introduce some aspects
of Singapore’s unique multi-culturalism. While the SEHS students interacted
with their buddies, their teachers had rich interactions and professional
exchanges with TMJC teachers as we shared and learnt from each other. All
in all, it was a day of meaningful learning and new friendships built for
all involved. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>JC2 SG Perspectives Dialogue on ‘The Future of Work’&nbsp;</h4>
<p>On 5 July, our JC2 students had the invaluable opportunity to hear from
Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Minister for Trade and Industry Mr Gan
Kim Yong on ‘The Future of Work’. His visit is part of the SG Perspectives
initiative that seeks to broaden student perspectives on the wide-ranging
impact of national issues. Students learnt about the importance of lifelong
learning in order to thrive in a dynamic and ever-changing work landscape
characterised by geopolitical contestation, the green transition and artificial
intelligence. Our students also engaged him in a robust discussion on topics
such as the future of the finance industry in Singapore, the unique role
Singapore plays in trade negotiations, and the need for international collaboration
to achieve better outcomes amid current US-China trade tensions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The college would like to thank DPM Gan for this most enriching session.
The college would also like to thank the Ministry of Trade and Industry
and the Ministry of Education (Character &amp; Citizenship Education Branch)
