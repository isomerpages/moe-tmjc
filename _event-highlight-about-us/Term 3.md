<h3>Racial Harmony Day 2025</h3>
<p>In collaboration with the Student Leadership Development Team and Culture
Promotion Club that comprise the Student Organising Committee, the college
commemorated Racial Harmony Day (RHD) 2025 from 21 July to 31 July. The
theme for this year’s Racial Harmony Day (RHD) Commemoration is '<em>Our People, Our Tapestry</em>'
and the focus was on building bridges to preserve Singapore’s Multicultural
Heritage. This was done through a 3-part commemoration:
<br>
<br>Part 1 involved a whole-school sharing by members of the Student Organising
Committee on the significance of Singapore’s Multicultural Culinary Heritage.
They shared personal recollections on the transformative and unifying power
of food. Part 2 helped students gain a closer look at race through student-driven
reflective CCE lessons to deepen cross-cultural knowledge and skills in
students. The JC1 CG Leaders applied facilitation skills learnt during
the RHD CG Leaders Facilitation Workshop to facilitate CCE class discussions
on race-based issues. Meanwhile, through game-based learning, JC2 students
deepened their multicultural understanding and respect of their own and
others’ cultural experiences, practices and perspectives.
<br>
<br>Finally, Part 3 encompassed experiential food tasting in the canteen to
reinforce love for Singapore’s multicultural cuisine, alongside curated
videos by members of the Culture Promotion Club. Free (on a first-come,
first-served basis) “Singapore Rojak” that symbolises Singapore’s racial
harmony was served, alongside other multicultural iconic delicacies like
Nonya kueh and Roti Prata. A bonus this year is the SG60 RHD Whole College
Activity which will feature food review recommendations of all 60 CGs (JC1s
and JC2s). Their submissions, 1 per CG, will be compiled into a food guide
that will be disseminated to all later this year.</p>

<h3>TM Run 2025</h3>
<p>TMJC’s very first college event of the new semester took place on 16 July
2025 at Bedok Reservoir Park. This event aimed to promote physical activity,
social bonding and healthy competition amongst students and staff of TMJC.
TM Run 2025 consisted of a 3.8-km competitive race, a 2.4-km mass run/walk
and Inter-House cheer competition. The route took participants along the
scenic loop of Bedok Reservoir, ending at the PAssion Wave Bedok Reservoir
building. The competitive race pitted the speed and endurance of individuals
against one another, while the 2.4-km mass run ended with a celebration
of friendship and camaraderie. Some of our staff also competed in the staff
race, or participated in the mass run with their students. In preparation
for TM Run as a culminating event, students were taught the concepts of
pacing, effort judgment, as well as the varying types and intensities of
running-related activities as part of a well-structured Physical Education
programme at TMJC.</p>

<h3>Shandong Experimental High School Visit</h3>
<p>We were excited to host a group of 60 students and 4 teachers from Shandong
Experimental High School (SEHS) for a one-day school immersion on 17 July
2025. The SEHS students had the opportunity to experience being a TMJC
student for the day as they attended lessons and activities with their
TMJC buddies. They ended their TMJC experience with a cultural activity
workshop specially curated by our Cultural Promotion Club to introduce
some aspects of Singapore’s unique multi-culturalism. While the SEHS students
interacted with their buddies, their teachers had rich interactions and
professional exchanges with TMJC teachers as we shared and learnt from
each other. All in all, it was a day of meaningful learning and new friendships
built for all involved.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>JC1 SG Perspectives - Ministry of Foreign Affairs Engagement Session</h3>
<p>On 3 July, our JC1 students had the unique opportunity to engage Ambassador
Mr Lim Thuan Kuan, in dialogue. The Ambassador’s engagement session was
part of the ‘SG Perspectives’ Programme which seeks to broaden students’
perspectives of Singapore’s foreign policy and how it affects them.
<br>
<br>Through Ambassador Lim’s sharing, students were sensitised to the key
principles of Singapore’s foreign policy and her persistent vulnerabilities
as a small country. They also learnt about how foreign policy impacts their
lives. Finally, our students engaged him in a robust Q&amp;A session on
contemporary issues that impact Singapore—such as the ongoing Israel-Hamas
conflict and US-China tensions.
<br>
<br>The college would like to thank Ambassador Lim for this most enriching
session. The college would also like to thank the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and the Ministry of Education (Character &amp; Citizenship Education Branch)
for co-organising this dialogue for the benefit of our students.</p>
