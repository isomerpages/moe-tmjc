<h4>TMJC Economics Edventure Learning Day 21 November 2023: Micro and Macro Economic Insights into the Singapore Economy</h4>
<p>The JC1 Economics students embarked on a journey of discovery, fun and
insights into micro issues such as how firms work and decisions made and
macro issues such as environmental sustainability (economic growth) and
policies. They visited Elba E-Waste, Comcrop, You Tiao Man, and the Monetary
Authority of Singapore. They also learnt about financial literacy and investment
through games and activities such as the CPF Catching Insomnia game, the
Last Reserve Game and GIC Safe House programme. Our JC1 Economics students
had an interesting day seeing how Economics come alive #TMJCEconomicsEnrichment

<h4>Embracing Inclusivity with The Purple Parade 2023</h4>
<p>At TMJC, we believe in the power of unity and celebrating the abilities
of all individuals, including Persons with Disabilities in Singapore. The
Purple Parade is not just an event; it is a movement that promotes awareness
and advocates inclusivity.</p>
<p>On 4 November 2023, our student representatives from the Interact Club
had the privilege to participate in the contingent march of the Purple
Parade 2023 at Suntec City, standing alongside Cerebral Palsy Alliance
Singapore (CPAS).</p>
<p>Prior to the actual parade, our staff also showed our support by ‚ÄúGoing
Purple‚Äù. Staff also supported our local community, especially small family
businesses with children who have special needs, like @lytmuztest and @junlefont.
By purchasing their delectable donuts and merchandise, we contributed to
the growth of these local entrepreneurs and created more opportunities
for individuals with special needs.</p>
<p>Let us continue to promote inclusivity, and be a part of The Purple Parade's
mission to create a more inclusive Singapore. üíú‚ú®</p>

<h4>Deepavali Celebrations 2023</h4>
<p>Deepavali celebrations 2023 at TMJC was a vibrant affair put together
by our very own Tamil Language and non-Tamil Indian Languages students
who started a student-initiated Indian Activity Club (IAC) this year. The
IAC kicked off the celebrations on 18 October with an assembly programme
to share about Deepavali traditions and featured vibrant dance and singing
performances.</p>
<p>A CG bonding activity was organised on 19 October in which CGs came together
to create Diya lamp cards ü™î and enjoyed tasting delicious murukku with
classmates! The Diyas created were used to decorate the festive corner
at TM Cove which was set up for students to chill out and enjoy some DIY
activities like henna painting, rangoli and lamp painting activities, and
to foster a sense of community amongst students.</p>
<p>The activity that wrapped up the celebrations was the Cultural Exchange
VIA at Poi Ching School on 31 October. In the activity, the IAC members
shared with Poi Ching students on Deepavali traditions and set up experiential
booths for them to try out murukku making, thoranam decor making, indian
dance and music.</p>
<p>The myriad of activities and events have given our students an immersive
cultural experience, setting the mood for Deepavali, the festival of lights!</p>

<h4>JC2 Awards Ceremony and Farewell Assembly</h4>
<p>On 13 October 2023, we officially bade farewell to our students from the
Class of 2023. The day started off with the annual Tembusu Tree Planting
Ceremony, where the graduating batch planted a Tembusu tree to commemorate
the shared experiences and achievements of their cohort.</p>
<p>The next segment was the Awards Ceremony, where the cohort celebrated
the achievements of their peers in both academic and co-curricular areas.
It was a joyous occasion where all JC2 students gathered in the hall to
cheer on their friends who were recognised for their contributions and
accomplishments.</p>
<p>This was followed by the Farewell Assembly programme, where teachers and
juniors offered their well-wishes through heartwarming and captivating
videos as well as mesmerising live performances. Students sang and clapped
along to song parodies and ended off on a high with the college 'O' cheer,
punctuated with a special appearance by the newly minted College mascot,
Skye.</p>
<p>Each student was also given a memento consisting of a Farewell Booklet
and a TMJC graduation bear to remember their College days. Student Leaders
also received a charging cable kit in appreciation of their service and
contribution.</p>
<p>We wish the graduating cohort all the best for their 'A' Levels and their
future endeavours. TM Boleh!</p>

<h4>Visit by students from Rysensteen Gymnasium, Denmark</h4>
<p>On 10 October, we had the pleasure of hosting staff and students from
Rysensteen Gymnasium, Denmark. Our Citizenship Education Ambassadors played
host to their Danish buddies who experienced a day in the life of a TMJC
student in the post-exam season. True to their trip‚Äôs anthropological focus,
our Danish friends woke up early that morning and took public transportation
to College to experience the morning rush hour commute. A welcome breakfast
consisting of traditional breakfast dishes such as Nasi Lemak and Fried
Beehoon awaited them, followed by cross-cultural learning about the education
systems of both countries and classroom lesson immersion. Later that afternoon,
the buddy pairs explored community building efforts in Our Tampines Hub,
alongside supporting local businesses and tasting traditional Singaporean
desserts such as the ‚ÄòSingaporean ice-cream sandwich‚Äô made of melted ice-cream
blocks wrapped with a slice of rainbow bread. A wonderful time of cross-cultural
interaction and learning was had by all!</p>

<h4>Teachers‚Äô Day 2023</h4>
<p>All aboard Flight TM2023! In line with our theme, ‚ÄòTeachers Change the
World‚Äô, TMJC celebrated the kindness, generosity and hardwork of our teachers
by bringing them on a holiday experience around the world.</p>
<p>Our School Leaders started the celebrations dressed as flight Captains
at Morning Assembly where our Principal, Mr Sin, thanked and encouraged
our teachers in continuing to inspire each and every one of us. TMJCians
then spent some quality time with their Civics Tutors and Subject Tutors
during class-based celebrations where we pampered our teachers with a meaningful
collection of short appreciation notes and a bag tag to encourage them
to take a little travel break when they can! Games and food were also shared
in this personalised part of the celebration, or rather pre-flight refreshments.</p>
<p>The celebrations then culminated in the in-flight entertainment in the
hall which was a flight-themed concert that brought us on a journey around
the world with performances inspired by the likes of cities like Tokyo,
New York and of course, Singapore. Our concert ended with a heartening
video collage of memories of our teachers at work to the meaningful song
‚ÄòYou have made a Difference‚Äô by Brian Asselin. Indeed teachers,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou have made a difference You have shaped our minds You have changed
the world One child at a time You have always been there In everything
you do We hope that you're as proud of us As we are proud of you‚Äù</p>
<p>Happy Teachers‚Äô Day!</p>
