<h3>Lumiere 2024: A Celebration of Diversity and Connection</h3>
<p>This year’s Lumiere concert was a dazzling celebration of diversity, uniting
students through the universal language of art. The annual event saw an
array of performances inspired by various cultural backgrounds, art forms,
and styles, highlighting the vibrancy and inclusivity of our school community.
<br>
<br>A refreshing addition this year was the video interviews with performers,
offering deeper insights into their artistic intentions. These stories
brought an added layer of meaning, connecting the audience with the performers'
personal journeys and motivations.
<br>
<br>Among the many memorable moments, Mill and Nannaphat captivated the audience
with their mashup of the Thai song titled “To All the Dreamers” and “Drag
Me Down”. Their heartfelt performance delivered a powerful message of resilience,
inspiring everyone to keep pursuing their dreams. Equally moving was the
lyrical contemporary dance performed by Lea Kit and friends, set to “You
Will Be Found” from Dear Evan Hansen. Their graceful performance reminded
us of the importance of friendship and compassion, especially during moments
of loneliness.
<br>
<br>Lumiere 2024 was more than a concert - it was a celebration of the beauty
that emerges when diverse voices come together. It left us not just entertained,
but inspired to embrace our differences and shine brighter together!</p>

<h3>TM Interest Unscripted</h3>
<p>The annual TM Interest Unscripted, held on 12 November, provided a platform
for students to showcase and share their passions with their peers, with
the aim of encouraging their fellow peers to discover new skills and interests
that align with their personal aspirations.
<br>
<br>The diverse topics of presentations made the even an interactive and engaging
experience. In the presentation on “From Batter to Bliss- A Journey in
Baking” by Heidi from 24S208, students were treated to freshly baked cookies
made by Heidi, adding a delightfully delicious element to the learning.
"The Circular Classroom - A Sewing Project" presentation by Krystal and
Han Yin from 24A301, and Annisa from 24S502, which focussed on sustainable
sewing practices, invited the audience to appreciate tote bags made from
repurposed TMJC uniforms, thereby spotlighting the value of upcycling.
During the "Strokes of Beauty" presentation by Jodi from 24A302, students
gained hands-on experience in Chinese calligraphy, allowing them to learn
the delicate art of brushwork. Lastly, the "Art in Our Free Time" presentation
by Le Yi and Sin Yee from 24S502 expanded students' creative horizons,
covering various artistic forms such as drawing, painting, and pop dancing.
<br>
<br>The student audience found the presentations both informative and inspirational,
motivating many of them to explore at least one of the showcased interests
further. TM Interest Unscripted was a truly memorable and impactful event,
sparking a renewed curiosity and eagerness among students to learn new
knowledge and explore new activities.</p>

<h3>JC2 Awards Ceremony and Farewell Assembly 2024</h3>
<p>On 11 October 2024, we bade farewell to our students from the Class of
2024. The day started with the unveiling of the Stairway to Excellence
Mural, where students from the graduating cohort designed a beautiful mural
for the staircase risers of the first flight of steps of the spiral staircase.
The mural represents not just the cohort’s achievements, but also their
commitment to excellence as they embark on their journey beyond TMJC.</p>
<p>The next segment was the Awards Ceremony, where the cohort celebrated
the achievements of their peers in both academic and co-curricular areas.
It was a joyous occasion where all JC2 students gathered in the hall to
cheer on their friends who were recognised for their contributions and
accomplishments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third highlight of the day was the Farewell Assembly programme. It
commenced with Mr Sin’s opening address where he shared his well-wishes
and gave valuable advice to the cohort. The juniors then shared their deepest
appreciation to their seniors for their guidance and support in welcoming
them to their respective CCA groups. Loud cheers rang through the hall
when it was the teachers’ turn to deliver their heartfelt messages for
the JC2 students through captivating, sentimental videos and mesmerising
live choreographed performances. The event ended on a high with the College
Anthem, College 'O' cheer and College ‘Satu Nada’ cheer with our well-loved
College mascot, Skye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each student was given our beloved TMJC Skye plushie as a meaningful memento
to remember their TMJC experience. Student Leaders also received a specially
crafted Skye mug in appreciation of their service and contribution to our
College.</p>
<p>From the bottom of our hearts, we wish the graduating cohort all the best
for their A-Levels and their future endeavours. TM Boleh!</p>

<h3>SG Perspectives (Staff) with Permanent Secretary Mr Aubeck Kam</h3>
<p>On 11 October, our teachers had the unique privilege of engaging Permanent
Secretary (Home Affairs Development, and Social and Family Development)
Mr Aubeck Kam in dialogue as part of the SG Perspectives Programme which
seeks to broaden perspectives on contemporary issues that impact Singapore.
Permanent Secretary Kam spoke on the challenges and importance of “Securing
the Future of Homeland Security in Singapore.” The staff gained an insight
into the crucial role that they can play in educating students on issues
of national concern such as online youth self-radicalisation and the increase
in young drug offenders. The College would like to thank PS Kam for the
enriching session. The College would also like to thank the Ministry of
Education Character &amp; Citizenship Education Branch for co-organising
this dialogue for the benefit of our teachers.</p>

<h3>TMJC Higher Education and Careers Fest 2024</h3>
<p>On 9 Oct 2024, our students took part in a valuable higher education and
career exploration day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It kicked off with an informative SkillsFuture Advice workshop, where
they learnt about industry trends, emerging skills, and useful resources
to help them make informed decisions about their future career. The highlight
was the bustling higher education and careers fair, where students, along
with many parents, had the opportunity to engage with industry representatives
and explore different exciting pathways. The day wrapped up with insightful
sharing sessions by industry professionals, giving students a more concrete
understanding of the different careers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're hopeful that this experience has provided our students with useful
information and motivation as they consider their future paths. It was
encouraging to see their active participation and interest throughout the
day's activities.</p>

<h3>Explore! Copenhagen 2024 Exchange</h3>
<p>From 4 to 8 October, participants of the upcoming Explore! Copenhagen
2024 trip had the pleasure of hosting students from Rysensteen Gymnasium,
Denmark. Our students provided their Danish counterparts a first-hand experience
of life in Singapore through a weekend homestay experience.</p>
<p>On 7 October, as part of their trip’s anthropological focus, the Danish
students and their local buddies participated in the Faithful Footprints
Interfaith Heritage Learning Journey conducted by Humanity Matters to learn
about Singapore’s rich multicultural heritage. The programme aimed to help
participants understand Singapore's unique model of multiculturalism through
experiential journeys to religious sites in the Bencoolen area where participants
learnt stories of the contributions and collaborations of pioneer migrant
and faith communities. Our Danish friends’ immersion into the Singaporean
way of life culminated in their participation in the Student Leaders’ Congress
organised by the College’s Student Leadership Committee. Danish students
and TM student leaders broadened their perspectives through dialoguing
and learning about the shared challenges of nation-building. A wonderful
time of cross-cultural interaction and learning was had by all!</p>
