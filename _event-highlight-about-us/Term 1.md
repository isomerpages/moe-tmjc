### JC1 Awards Ceremony

On 18 January 2023, we recognised and celebrated the consistent good achievements of students in their JC1 journey in 2022 during our JC1 Awards Ceremony.  Our students who had performed well in their JC1 assessments were presented with the TMJC Book Prize (Bronze) and the Best in Subject Award for the different subjects by our Heads of Department. Students can look forward to bagging the Silver and Gold medals for exemplary accomplishments in JC2 and at their A Levels. This series of awards aim to inspire our students to apply themselves consistently and to strive for their personal best in their JC journey.  
  
Our Guest of Honour, Mr Jonathan Teo, an alumnus of TMJC, encouraged the cohort in his opening address and presented the MOE Edusave Character Award as well as the TMJC Alumni Scholarship to deserving students.  
  
Congratulations to all award recipients!



### TMJC Open House 2023

On 13 January 2023, TMJC held our first post COVID-19 Open House to welcome visitors.   

TM Wonderland, the theme for Open House 2023, aimed to create unique experiences for visitors by infusing magical, whimsical elements into our programmes and activities.  
  
Our Principal, Mr Sin Kim Ho, provided insight into the JC curriculum that enabled our visitors to gain a deeper understanding of their new and exciting journey ahead.  
  
The subject talks and booths set up by our dedicated staff gave prospective students a glimpse of our TMJC programmes.  
  
In addition, our committed students came together to set up informative CCA booths and put together rousing performances during the CCA showcase, Opening and Closing ceremonies. It was indeed a magical day where visitors experienced our strong College spirit and dynamic culture.  
  
TM Wonderland ended memorably with a group shot of our staff, students and visitors at the College hall to commemorate this significant day.  
  
Thank you for being a part of TM Wonderland!

### First Day of School at Tampines Meridian Junior College 2023

On 9 January 2023, TMJC welcomed our students back to College with a series of “Back-to-School” activities to reconnect with their friends and teachers.  
  
The “Back-to-School” programme began with an opening address by our new Principal, Mr Sin Kim Ho.  As a symbolic gesture of appreciation and care, the 5th TMSC President, Gerrard Poh, led the TMSC and JC2 CG leaders to present apples to the school leaders, teachers and support staff.

One of the highlights of the day was the “Staff vs Student Challenge” where students from 5 different Houses held friendly competitions with their teachers in various activities. This was a great opportunity for students to catch their teachers in action outside the classroom.

The House Captains teamed up with the OGLs to lead in the House cheers to bring further excitement during the games. This was followed by a communal tea break provided by the College for the students to bond with their Civics Tutors and classmates.
