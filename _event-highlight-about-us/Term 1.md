<h4>Open House 2024</h4><p>TMJC buzzed with vibrant energy and enthusiasm during our Open House on January 12, 2024!  ðŸŽ‰ TM SKYEscape served as an inspiration for the incoming batch of learners and leaders.</p><p>Our campus was filled with eager prospective students, parents, and visitors exploring the various CCA and Subject booths helmed by our enthusiastic students and teachers. Through these experiences, our visitors had the chance to delve into the rich tapestry of academic and extracurricular opportunities that TMJC provides. College Tours, led by passionate student ambassadors, provided a firsthand glimpse into student life and insights into what makes the TMJC experience unique. </p><p>The School Leaders' Talk, featuring inspiring insights from alumni, added a touch of wisdom to the day and answered many of the pertinent questions that our visitors had about College life and the A Level curriculum.</p><p>A big highlight of the event was the very first official public appearance of our College mascot, SKYE. TM SKYEscape ended on a high note with a group shot of our staff, students and visitors at the College hall. </p><p>Thank you for being a part of TM SKYEscape! <br><br>#whyTM <br>#TMSKYEscape<br>#TMJCOpenHouse2024</p><h4>TM Greenwall</h4><p>As part of the TMJC Eco Stewardship Programme, our TM Greenwall Structure was established on 8 January by five TMJC JC2 students. The Greenwall Structure aims to provide learning opportunities across various disciplines, fostering a holistic approach to achieving the 4Cs: Curriculum, Campus, Culture, and Community in the realm of sustainability. This initiative aligns with the Singapore Green Plan 2030, specifically emphasising the "City in Nature" pillar within TMJC.<br><br>With the Greenwall Structure now in place, and under the guidance of teachers, students will actively contribute to its maintenance while concurrently investigating and analysing factors related to sustainability and climate change. The intention is for the Greenwall Structure to serve as an interactive educational tool, enabling students to comprehend Ecology, Sustainability, and Biology in real-time.</p><p>By engaging in this initiative, we anticipate that students will not only deepen their understanding of the environment but also cultivate a sense of responsibility towards ecological stewardship. This hands-on experience aligns with our commitment to nurture environmentally conscious and informed citizens who are well-equipped to address the challenges posed by climate change in the future.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Event Highlights/2024/2024_T1_Events_TMGreenwall_01.jpg"></div><p></p><p></p>
