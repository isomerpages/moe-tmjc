### First Day of School at Tampines Meridian Junior College 2023

On 9 January 2023, TMJC welcomed our students back to College with a series of “Back-to-School” activities to reconnect with their friends and teachers.  
  
The “Back-to-School” programme began with an opening address by our new Principal, Mr Sin Kim Ho.  As a symbolic gesture of appreciation and care, the 5th TMSC President, Gerrard Poh, led the TMSC and JC2 CG leaders to present apples to the school leaders, teachers and support staff.

One of the highlights of the day was the “Staff vs Student Challenge” where students from 5 different Houses held friendly competitions with their teachers in various activities. This was a great opportunity for students to catch their teachers in action outside the classroom.

The House Captains teamed up with the OGLs to lead in the House cheers to bring further excitement during the games. This was followed by a communal tea break provided by the College for the students to bond with their Civics Tutors and classmates.
