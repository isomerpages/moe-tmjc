<h3>Open House 2025</h3>
<p>On 11 January, we hosted our Open House, inviting visitors to explore,
discover and immerse in the unique TMJC experience. Aligned with our theme,
Skye’s Story, our Principal, Mr Sin, alumnus and current students engaged
in a dialogue session about different aspects of the JC curriculum and
the journey that a TMJCian goes through during their two-year stay. Through
their sharing, our prospective students and their parents gained valuable
insights into the academic experience and holistic student development
opportunities that shape our students' journeys.
<br>
<br>At the subject booths, teachers, students, and alumni were on hand to
answer queries about the various subjects. Additionally, our Admissions
and ECG teams shared important information about the application process
and post-O Level options. Our student ambassadors also shared their unique
perspectives and stories as they interacted with our guests during the
campus tour.
<br>
<br>The other highlight of the Open House was the CCA booths whereby our TMJC
students enthusiastically engaged with the visitors as they showcased highlights
of their respective CCAs. This included vibrant and exciting performances,
including presentations by our Chinese Orchestra, Choir, English Drama,
Guitar Ensemble, Modern Dance, Symphonic Band, and Wushu.
<br>
<br>Open House 2025 ended on a high note with our students cheering as one,
demonstrating our strong College spirit. A big thank you to everyone for
being part of Skye’s Story!
