meaningful 2 years in TMJC. The JC1s then proudly put on their College
collar pins together, signifying the official start of their wonderful

<h4>Commemorating 40 years of Total Defence (TD40)</h4>
<p>The College commemorated 40 years of Total Defence Day under the theme
‚ÄúTogether, We Keep Singapore Strong‚Äù. Amid crisis and disruptions such
as geopolitical and geoeconomic developments that impact Singapore, the
significance of Total Defence remains ever relevant. The focus for TD40
was thus on preparing students to respond to potential disruptions. Two
highlights of the commemoration stand out.</p>
<p>On 15 February, the officially designated commemoration day, the college
simulated a 1-hour disruption to power supply as part of Singapore‚Äôs first
nationwide Total Defence exercise. Following the exercise, students reflected
on their experience and shared their thoughts and feelings with their classmates
through guided discussion.</p>
<p>The JC1s also participated in an experiential learning journey to SDC
to gain a better understanding of the emerging security threats Singapore
faces and the important role they can play to ensure our nation‚Äôs well-being.
As this was the students‚Äô first outing together as a class, they also forged
deeper ties with one another as well as with their Civics Tutors!</p>

<h4>5D4N Culture, Heritage, and the Arts (CHA) Trip ‚Äì Yogyakarta, Indonesia</h4>
<p>From 27 November to 1 December 2023, a group of JC1 students embarked
on a Culture, Heritage and the Arts experience trip to Yogyakarta, Indonesia.
Yogyakarta, Indonesia, is situated near three UNESCO World Heritage sites,
and is an exciting and accessible destination for a deeper understanding
of South-East Asia. It is a living historical city, rich in Javanese traditional
architecture and culture, making it a key tourist destination. Granted
the status of ‚ÄúSpecial Region‚Äù, Yogyakarta offers a unique perspective
on how a culturally-rich city navigates its own path towards modern development.
<br>
<br>During the trip, students learnt the broad sociological changes, perspectives
and impacts of Yogyakarta‚Äôs identity through the culture, heritage, and
the arts of her society and community. Our students engaged in craft-making,
understood the geographical and historical significance of important landmarks,
learnt classical dance, and interacted with various members of the Yogyakarta
arts community.Through the various experiential activities and insightful
discussions about the preservation of culture, our TMJC participants gained
new knowledge, enthusiasm and appreciation for past, present and future
cultural significance of Yogyakarta, Singapore, and the larger Southeast
Asian region.
<br>
<br>Overall, it was a fulfilling, insightful, and fun experience!</p>

<h4>ExPlore! Vietnam</h4>
<p>Service Learning @ Ho Chi Minh City was a week of transformative and meaningful
experiences that left a lasting impact on both the students and teachers
who went for the trip. Volunteering at local charity schools and orphanages
provided the opportunity to connect with the resilient spirits of the children.
Through shared laughter, games and art activities, bonds were formed that
transcended language barriers. The warmth and gratitude our students received
from the children illuminated the power of compassion and the joy that
simple acts of kindness can bring. The trip also provided our students
with the opportunity to immerse in the local culture through delightful
culinary explorations and spirited games, making new friends and creating
lasting memories along the way.
<br>
<br>The historical aspect of the trip took our students to the Cu Chi Tunnels,
a complex underground network that played a crucial role during the Vietnam
War. As they navigated through the forest and narrow passages of the tunnels,
they gained a profound understanding of the resilience and resourcefulness
of the Vietnamese people. The tales of survival and ingenuity underscored
the role of history in shaping their present and future.
<br>
<br>The combination of service learning, cultural experiences and historical
insights made the trip to Ho Chi Minh City an unforgettable and deeply
enriching journey. As our students immersed themselves in the rich tapestry
of Vietnam's culture and history, their time there not only broadened their
global awareness but also instilled in them a sense of responsibility and
empathy.</p>

<h4>MLEP Overseas Immersion Trip 2023</h4>
<p>Over a span of six days, the Malay Language Elective Programme students
embarked on an overseas immersion journey to Perak and Selangor in Malaysia.
Our itinerary included attending academic lectures on Malay literature
at Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI) and participating in a theater
workshop at ASWARA. We were also privileged to have an interaction session
with the Orang Asli community from Kampung Chinggung in Perak. Engaging
with the Orang Asli provided us with a deeper understanding of their worldview
and culture. Additionally, we actively took part in a community cooking
event where we prepared the traditional Malay porridge (Bubur Lambuk) as
well as a local dessert known as Bubur Anak Lebah. Exploring the local
traditions, we attempted to learn a simple traditional Malay dance and
were treated to a play by UPSI undergraduates. The highlight of the trip
was undoubtedly the thrilling mudfishing activity, where we endeavored
to catch catfish using our bare hands in a muddy pond.
<br>
<br>Overall, the experience was highly memorable. Our students gained valuable
insights into how the people of Perak and Selangor strive to preserve their
cultural heritage amidst modernisation and successfully maintaining their
identity despite the influence of Western culture. These experiences will
undoubtedly contribute to our ongoing exploration of Malay heritage and
culture in our daily lives.</p>

<h4>Open House 2024</h4>
<p>TMJC buzzed with vibrant energy and enthusiasm during our Open House on
January 12, 2024! üéâ TM SKYEscape served as an inspiration for the incoming
batch of learners and leaders.</p>
<p>Our campus was filled with eager prospective students, parents, and visitors
exploring the various CCA and Subject booths helmed by our enthusiastic
students and teachers. Through these experiences, our visitors had the
chance to delve into the rich tapestry of academic and extracurricular
opportunities that TMJC provides. College Tours, led by passionate student
ambassadors, provided a firsthand glimpse into student life and insights
into what makes the TMJC experience unique.</p>
<p>The School Leaders' Talk, featuring inspiring insights from alumni, added
a touch of wisdom to the day and answered many of the pertinent questions
that our visitors had about College life and the A Level curriculum.</p>
<p>A big highlight of the event was the very first official public appearance
of our College mascot, SKYE. TM SKYEscape ended on a high note with a group
shot of our staff, students and visitors at the College hall.</p>

<h4>TM Greenwall</h4>
<p>As part of the TMJC Eco Stewardship Programme, our TM Greenwall Structure
was established on 8 January by five TMJC JC2 students. The Greenwall Structure
aims to provide learning opportunities across various disciplines, fostering
a holistic approach to achieving the 4Cs: Curriculum, Campus, Culture,
and Community in the realm of sustainability. This initiative aligns with
the Singapore Green Plan 2030, specifically emphasising the "City in Nature"
pillar within TMJC.
<br>
<br>With the Greenwall Structure now in place, and under the guidance of teachers,
students will actively contribute to its maintenance while concurrently
investigating and analysing factors related to sustainability and climate
change. The intention is for the Greenwall Structure to serve as an interactive
educational tool, enabling students to comprehend Ecology, Sustainability,
and Biology in real-time.</p>
<p>By engaging in this initiative, we anticipate that students will not only
deepen their understanding of the environment but also cultivate a sense
of responsibility towards ecological stewardship. This hands-on experience
aligns with our commitment to nurture environmentally conscious and informed
citizens who are well-equipped to address the challenges posed by climate
change in the future.</p>
