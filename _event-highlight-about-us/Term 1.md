### Chinese New Year Celebrations 2023

On 20 January, TMJC ushered in the Lunar New Year of the Rabbit with celebratory activities, revolving around the theme of “Return of Spring and A New Year of Vitality”.  
  
The programme started with CGs displaying their creativity by making CNY handicraft using red packets. The handicraft consisted of lanterns, firecrackers and new year greeting cards which were displayed along the study area outside the General Office, adding cheer to the festive mood.

Students also watched a student-directed short film produced by the Citizenship Education Committee, highlighting the different symbolic meanings of Rabbit in Asian countries. This was followed by an inter-CG Kahoot Quiz to heighten students’ awareness of the citizenship messages behind the film.  
  
The second segment of the programme gathered all teachers and students in the Hall for a kaleidoscope of performances put up by various CCA groups. Students from the Chinese Orchestra, Choir, Modern Dance, Wushu and Taekwondo staged performances of celebratory music, songs, dance and martial arts, heightening the festive cheer. Teachers Ms Ann Koh and Mr Wong Hoe Sing also added to the festive cheer with their live song performances. As part of the Lunar New Year tradition, the student leaders presented mandarin oranges to our school leaders and staff to express their gratitude and appreciation.
