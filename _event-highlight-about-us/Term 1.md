<h4>TM Unites 2024 - One TMJC, One Community</h4>
<p>&nbsp;On 2nd March 2024, JC2 students and staff demonstrated unity by
actively participating in various Values in Action (VIA) projects to make
a positive impact in the community as part of TM Unites—the JC2 cohort
VIA, embodying the theme 'One TMJC, One Community’.
<br>
<br>TM Unites consisted of four community service efforts taking place concurrently
that morning. Firstly, there was the East Coast Park Clean-Up where students
did their part to keep our parks clean by removing litter and debris. A
second project saw students embark on a heartwarming project to pack and
deliver care packs to households in 212A Pasir Ris Street 12 and 476A Pasir
Ris Drive 6, spreading love and joy. Additionally, another group of JC2
students actively engaged with Tampines Central residents, conducting door-to-door
interactions to educate them on proper recycling practices and collect
recyclables. The students also participated in an estate clean-up, contributing
to a cleaner environment. Lastly, some of our students supported the Bloom
with Hope event as student helpers to help run the event, assist with stage
events and booth activities, as well as joining Tampines residents to participate
in the 3.5km-walk, all in a stand in unison with the community in the mission
to combat cancer, supporting each other every step of the way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TM Unites underscores our collective commitment to work together as a
college to make a positive impact on the community. By fostering a sense
of unity and shared responsibility, we hope to continue engaging our community
and inspire positive change both within our college and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>TM Connects 2024</h4>
<p>TM Connects, a community awareness event organised by the TMJC Values
in Action (VIA) Committee, was held on 1 March 2024. This year, we had
a total of 19 organisations participating in the event, which included
talks as well as informative and experiential booths to engage our JC1
students. 10 JC2 student groups also took the opportunity to showcase their
VIA projects, as they looked to encourage their juniors to continue the
various community service efforts. We express our gratitude to our partner
organisations and the various JC2 students for enthusiastically sharing
insights on service learning with our JC1 students and inspiring them to
serve the community.</p>
<p>Through TM Connects, we hope that our JC1 students can develop an understanding
of various community issues, explore areas of interest, and select organisations
they wish to serve. Following this, we look forward to seeing our students
actively strive to enact positive changes within the community.</p>

<h4>JC1 Initiation - Badge Pinning Ceremony 2024</h4>
<p>TMJC held our annual JC1 Badge Pinning Ceremony on 26 February 2024 to
initiate the JC1s. The ceremony symbolises the beginning of the journey
taken together by the JC1s and JC2s as they forge ahead as one TMJC student
body.</p>
<p>During the ceremony, the CG Leaders from each JC2 class presented the
College collar pins to their JC1 juniors to welcome them to the TMJC family.
The JC2 seniors also shared their personal journeys, lessons learnt and
words of advice on what is truly essential in creating a memorable and
meaningful 2 years in TMJC. The JC1s then proudly put on their College
collar pins together, signifying the official start of their wonderful
and exciting journey ahead in TMJC. A warm welcome to TMJC, JC1s!</p>

<h4>Commemorating 40 years of Total Defence (TD40)</h4>
<p>The College commemorated 40 years of Total Defence Day under the theme
“Together, We Keep Singapore Strong”. Amid crisis and disruptions such
as geopolitical and geoeconomic developments that impact Singapore, the
significance of Total Defence remains ever relevant. The focus for TD40
was thus on preparing students to respond to potential disruptions. Two
highlights of the commemoration stand out.</p>
<p>On 15 February, the officially designated commemoration day, the college
simulated a 1-hour disruption to power supply as part of Singapore’s first
nationwide Total Defence exercise. Following the exercise, students reflected
on their experience and shared their thoughts and feelings with their classmates
through guided discussion.</p>
<p>The JC1s also participated in an experiential learning journey to SDC
to gain a better understanding of the emerging security threats Singapore
faces and the important role they can play to ensure our nation’s well-being.
As this was the students’ first outing together as a class, they also forged
deeper ties with one another as well as with their Civics Tutors!</p>

<h4>Chinese New Year Celebrations 2024</h4>
<p>On 9 February, TMJC ushered in the Lunar New Year of the Dragon with a
series of celebratory activities, revolving around the theme of “A New
Year of Courage and Strength”. The programme began with a short film produced
by the Citizenship Education Committee, highlighting the different symbolic
meanings of Dragon and New Year Traditions in Asian countries, to heighten
students’ awareness on the citizenship message behind the film.</p>
<p>The second segment was a kaleidoscope of performances put up by various
CCA groups. Students from the Chinese Orchestra, Choir, Modern Dance, Wushu
and Taekwondo brought much celebratory joy to all in the Hall with their
combination of music, songs, dance and martial arts.</p>
<p>During the finale, our School Leaders Mr Sin, Mrs Pang, Mr Ang and Ms
Yasmine, together with a group of enthusiastic teachers led everyone in
the mass singing of Chinese New Year songs, heightening the festive cheer.
In line with Lunar New Year tradition, the student leaders presented mandarin
oranges to all staff to express gratitude and appreciation.</p>
<p>Our Chinese New Year celebrations ended on a high note as we conducted
a mass Lo-Hei session as one big TMJC family. Everyone tossed the delicious
and colourful ingredients, saying new year well-wishes to each other and
fully immersing in this joyous festive celebration!</p>

<h4>5D4N Culture, Heritage, and the Arts (CHA) Trip – Yogyakarta, Indonesia</h4>
<p>From 27 November to 1 December 2023, a group of JC1 students embarked
on a Culture, Heritage and the Arts experience trip to Yogyakarta, Indonesia.
Yogyakarta, Indonesia, is situated near three UNESCO World Heritage sites,
and is an exciting and accessible destination for a deeper understanding
of South-East Asia. It is a living historical city, rich in Javanese traditional
architecture and culture, making it a key tourist destination. Granted
the status of “Special Region”, Yogyakarta offers a unique perspective
on how a culturally-rich city navigates its own path towards modern development.
<br>
<br>During the trip, students learnt the broad sociological changes, perspectives
and impacts of Yogyakarta’s identity through the culture, heritage, and
the arts of her society and community. Our students engaged in craft-making,
understood the geographical and historical significance of important landmarks,
learnt classical dance, and interacted with various members of the Yogyakarta
arts community.Through the various experiential activities and insightful
discussions about the preservation of culture, our TMJC participants gained
new knowledge, enthusiasm and appreciation for past, present and future
cultural significance of Yogyakarta, Singapore, and the larger Southeast
Asian region.
<br>
<br>Overall, it was a fulfilling, insightful, and fun experience!</p>

<h4>ExPlore! Vietnam</h4>
<p>Service Learning @ Ho Chi Minh City was a week of transformative and meaningful
experiences that left a lasting impact on both the students and teachers
who went for the trip. Volunteering at local charity schools and orphanages
provided the opportunity to connect with the resilient spirits of the children.
Through shared laughter, games and art activities, bonds were formed that
transcended language barriers. The warmth and gratitude our students received
from the children illuminated the power of compassion and the joy that
simple acts of kindness can bring. The trip also provided our students
with the opportunity to immerse in the local culture through delightful
culinary explorations and spirited games, making new friends and creating
lasting memories along the way.
<br>
<br>The historical aspect of the trip took our students to the Cu Chi Tunnels,
a complex underground network that played a crucial role during the Vietnam
War. As they navigated through the forest and narrow passages of the tunnels,
they gained a profound understanding of the resilience and resourcefulness
of the Vietnamese people. The tales of survival and ingenuity underscored
the role of history in shaping their present and future.
<br>
<br>The combination of service learning, cultural experiences and historical
insights made the trip to Ho Chi Minh City an unforgettable and deeply
enriching journey. As our students immersed themselves in the rich tapestry
of Vietnam's culture and history, their time there not only broadened their
global awareness but also instilled in them a sense of responsibility and
empathy.</p>

<h4>MLEP Overseas Immersion Trip 2023</h4>
<p>Over a span of six days, the Malay Language Elective Programme students
embarked on an overseas immersion journey to Perak and Selangor in Malaysia.
Our itinerary included attending academic lectures on Malay literature
at Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI) and participating in a theater
workshop at ASWARA. We were also privileged to have an interaction session
with the Orang Asli community from Kampung Chinggung in Perak. Engaging
with the Orang Asli provided us with a deeper understanding of their worldview
and culture. Additionally, we actively took part in a community cooking
event where we prepared the traditional Malay porridge (Bubur Lambuk) as
well as a local dessert known as Bubur Anak Lebah. Exploring the local
traditions, we attempted to learn a simple traditional Malay dance and
were treated to a play by UPSI undergraduates. The highlight of the trip
was undoubtedly the thrilling mudfishing activity, where we endeavored
to catch catfish using our bare hands in a muddy pond.
<br>
<br>Overall, the experience was highly memorable. Our students gained valuable
insights into how the people of Perak and Selangor strive to preserve their
cultural heritage amidst modernisation and successfully maintaining their
identity despite the influence of Western culture. These experiences will
undoubtedly contribute to our ongoing exploration of Malay heritage and
culture in our daily lives.</p>

batch of learners and leaders.</p>
<p>Our campus was filled with eager prospective students, parents, and visitors
exploring the various CCA and Subject booths helmed by our enthusiastic
students and teachers. Through these experiences, our visitors had the
chance to delve into the rich tapestry of academic and extracurricular
opportunities that TMJC provides. College Tours, led by passionate student
ambassadors, provided a firsthand glimpse into student life and insights
into what makes the TMJC experience unique.</p>
<p>The School Leaders' Talk, featuring inspiring insights from alumni, added
a touch of wisdom to the day and answered many of the pertinent questions
that our visitors had about College life and the A Level curriculum.</p>

<h4>TM Greenwall</h4>
<p>As part of the TMJC Eco Stewardship Programme, our TM Greenwall Structure
was established on 8 January by five TMJC JC2 students. The Greenwall Structure
aims to provide learning opportunities across various disciplines, fostering
a holistic approach to achieving the 4Cs: Curriculum, Campus, Culture,
and Community in the realm of sustainability. This initiative aligns with
the Singapore Green Plan 2030, specifically emphasising the "City in Nature"
pillar within TMJC.
<br>
<br>With the Greenwall Structure now in place, and under the guidance of teachers,
students will actively contribute to its maintenance while concurrently
investigating and analysing factors related to sustainability and climate
change. The intention is for the Greenwall Structure to serve as an interactive
educational tool, enabling students to comprehend Ecology, Sustainability,
and Biology in real-time.</p>
<p>By engaging in this initiative, we anticipate that students will not only
deepen their understanding of the environment but also cultivate a sense
of responsibility towards ecological stewardship. This hands-on experience
aligns with our commitment to nurture environmentally conscious and informed
citizens who are well-equipped to address the challenges posed by climate
change in the future.</p>
