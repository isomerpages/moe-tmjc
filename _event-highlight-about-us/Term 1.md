<h3>Chinese  New Year Celebrations 2025</h3>
<p>The 2025 Lunar New Year celebrations at Tampines Meridian Junior College
(TMJC) took place on 28 January, bringing the college community together
in a joyous and meaningful event. With the theme “Spring in Tampines Meridian,”
the festivities embraced the spirit of new beginnings, gratitude, and unity.
<br>
<br>The celebrations commenced with all JC2 students engaging in a Spring
Cleaning activity as part of the TM Sparkles Community Program. This initiative
reinforced the value of social responsibility, as students worked together
to clean various facilities in the College. More than just a practical
task, this symbolic act reflected the tradition of bidding farewell to
the old and welcoming new beginnings—a key theme of the Lunar New Year.
<br>
<br>Following the Spring Cleaning session, the college community gathered
in the Hall for an exciting array of performances by various CCA groups.
Students from the Chinese Orchestra, Guitar Ensemble, Taekwondo, Modern
Dance, and Wushu took the stage, captivating the audience with a dynamic
showcase of music, dance, and martial arts that heightened the festive
spirit.
<br>
<br>Adding to the celebratory atmosphere, our teachers, Ms Queenie Teo, Ms
Ong Yan Lin, Mr Lim Khoon Liang, and Mr Nicholas Chua took center stage
to lead the performers in a heartwarming rendition of traditional Lunar
New Year melodies, filling the hall with joy and camaraderie.
<br>
<br>The concert reached a thrilling climax with an electrifying Lion Dance
performance by NUS Lion Dance, a highlight of the celebration. As the lions
leaped and twirled across the stage, they presented auspicious New Year
couplets to Mr Sin Kim Ho, Principal of TMJC, and Mr Nelson Chua, Chairman
of the College Advisory Committee. The crowd erupted in cheers, embracing
the blessings of good fortune and prosperity.
<br>
<br>Continuing a cherished Lunar New Year tradition, student leaders presented
mandarin oranges to school leaders and staff, expressing their gratitude
and appreciation for their guidance and dedication. This simple yet heartfelt
gesture reinforced the values of respect and unity within the TMJC family.
The celebrations concluded on a high note with a college-wide Lo-Hei session,
a tradition symbolizing abundance, prosperity, and shared aspirations for
the year ahead. As students and staff tossed the ingredients high into
the air, laughter and well-wishes filled the room, marking the perfect
end to a meaningful and joyous Lunar New Year celebration.
<br>
<br>With hearts full of hope and spirits uplifted, the TMJC family welcomed
the new year with renewed energy, gratitude, and a strengthened sense of
community.

<h3><br><a href="http://OnePeople.SG" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OnePeople.SG</a> Model United Nations 2024</h3>
<p>9 students from our College participated in the <a href="http://OnePeople.SG" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OnePeople.sg</a> Model United Nations from 3-6
December 2024. Instead of focussing primarily on UN functions, students
attending the conference had the opportunity to look specifically at local
issues in Singapore. Our students took on the roles of local agencies and
government bodies to discuss hot button issues pertaining to race relations,
and worked towards consensus building. It is noteworthy that our students,
Yew Shang Hong and Riddhimaa Rampuria were accorded the Outstanding Delegate
award for the council they represented. Overall, our students had an enriching
time and thoroughly enjoyed hearing the different perspectives presented
by all participants!</p>

<h3>Open House 2025</h3>
<p>On 11 January, we hosted our Open House, inviting visitors to explore,
discover and immerse in the unique TMJC experience. Aligned with our theme,
Skye’s Story, our Principal, Mr Sin, alumnus and current students engaged
in a dialogue session about different aspects of the JC curriculum and
the journey that a TMJCian goes through during their two-year stay. Through
their sharing, our prospective students and their parents gained valuable
insights into the academic experience and holistic student development
opportunities that shape our students' journeys.
<br>
<br>At the subject booths, teachers, students, and alumni were on hand to
answer queries about the various subjects. Additionally, our Admissions
and ECG teams shared important information about the application process
and post-O Level options. Our student ambassadors also shared their unique
perspectives and stories as they interacted with our guests during the
campus tour.
<br>
<br>The other highlight of the Open House was the CCA booths whereby our TMJC
students enthusiastically engaged with the visitors as they showcased highlights
of their respective CCAs. This included vibrant and exciting performances,
including presentations by our Chinese Orchestra, Choir, English Drama,
Guitar Ensemble, Modern Dance, Symphonic Band, and Wushu.
<br>
<br>Open House 2025 ended on a high note with our students cheering as one,
demonstrating our strong College spirit. A big thank you to everyone for
being part of Skye’s Story!
