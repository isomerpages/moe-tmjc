<h4>TM Greenwall Write-Up<br></h4><p>As part of the TMJC Eco Stewardship Programme, our TM Greenwall Structure was established on 8 January by five TMJC JC2 students. The Greenwall Structure aims to provide learning opportunities across various disciplines, fostering a holistic approach to achieving the 4Cs: Curriculum, Campus, Culture, and Community in the realm of sustainability. This initiative aligns with the Singapore Green Plan 2030, specifically emphasising the "City in Nature" pillar within TMJC.</p><p>With the Greenwall Structure now in place, and under the guidance of teachers, students will actively contribute to its maintenance while concurrently investigating and analysing factors related to sustainability and climate change. The intention is for the Greenwall Structure to serve as an interactive educational tool, enabling students to comprehend Ecology, Sustainability, and Biology in real-time.</p><p>By engaging in this initiative, we anticipate that students will not only deepen their understanding of the environment but also cultivate a sense of responsibility towards ecological stewardship. This hands-on experience aligns with our commitment to nurture environmentally conscious and informed citizens who are well-equipped to address the challenges posed by climate change in the future.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Event Highlights/2024/2024_T1_Events_TMGreenwall_01.jpg"></div><p></p><p></p>
