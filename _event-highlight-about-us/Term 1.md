### TM Run 2023

TMJC’s very first College sporting event of the year took place on 8 March 2023 at OCBC Square. This event aims to promote physical activity, social bonding and healthy competition amongst students and staff of TMJC. The format for TM Run 2023 consisted of three running distances (3km, 2.4km and 1.6km) around Stadium Riverside Walk, Tanjong Rhu Promenade and Geylang Park Connector, starting and ending at the spectacular OCBC Square. Students participated in either the 3km or 2.4km competitive categories that pit the speed and endurance of individuals against one another or took part in the 1.6km Fun Run category that ended with a celebration of friendship and camaraderie. Staff competed in the 1.6km Staff Race or participated in the Fun Run alongside their students. There were also a good number of staff and students who volunteered as officials and helpers to ensure the success of the event. In preparation for TM Run, students were taught the concepts of pacing, effort judgement, as well as the varied types and intensities of running-related activities as part of a well-structured Physical Education programme at TMJC.

### TM Connects 2023

TM Connects, a community awareness event organised by the TMJC Values in Action (VIA) Committee, was carried out on 3 March 2023. This year, we have a total of 13 organisations and 8 JC2 VIA projects onboard.

Through TM Connects, we hope students would gain awareness and have a better understanding of different community issues, explore areas of interest and choose the organisations that they would like to serve. Thereafter, we hope TMJC students would seek to bring about positive changes to the community. 

We thank our partner organisations and students from selected JC2 CGs and CCA who have come forward and shared enthusiastically with our JC1 students about service learning via the booth and activity sharing.

### Total Defence Day 2023

The College commemorated Total Defence Day (TDD) from 15 February to 1 March 2023 under the theme “Together, We Keep Singapore Strong”. Introduced in 1984 to mark the day Singapore fell to Japanese troops in 1942, the annual TDD Commemoration exhorts every Singaporean to play a part to keep Singapore safe, secure and independent. 

This year, as Singapore transits into a post-COVID world filled with uncertainties, the significance of Total Defence remains ever relevant. A whole-of-society effort is needed to ensure resilience. In light of this, during their interactive Character & Citizenship Education lessons, students took perspective, discussed what Total Defence meant to them and learnt about the role they can play in Singapore’s national defence. Our Citizenship Education Ambassadors also participated in the national Total Defence Hackathon “YouthXHack” where they brainstormed solutions to tackle pressing real-life issues such as food supply disruptions through the use of technology. 

The commemoration culminated in a mural display outside the General Office, a collaboration between staff and students of the Citizenship Education Committee and the Art Unit. The mural functions as a daily visual reminder to all TMJC students on the importance of keeping Singapore strong in a spirit of togetherness.

### Singapore Chemistry and Biology Olympiads

In November 2022, 15 JC1 Chemistry and 16 JC1 Biology students represented the College at the Singapore Chemistry and Biology Olympiads respectively.

### Staff Learning Day 

On 15 February 2023, our staff had our first professional development time for the year! Staff got together in our departments and discussed ways to achieve our 2023 College learning goal of  "Deepening and Strengthening Assessment Literacy". 

During the session, teachers were engaged in conversations about the various teaching strategies highlighted from their selected department book. It was a fruitful session filled with insightful discussions and shared ideas to enact in our classrooms!

### GCE A-Level Results Release

On 17 February 2023, our students from the Class of 2022 returned to College to receive their GCE A Level Examination results. 

After the lifting of the safe management restrictions, this was the first time the students gathered in the hall as a cohort to receive their results. Our Principal Mr Sin shared the achievements of the Class of 2022 and congratulated our students who have achieved stellar results on stage. The College also broadcasted a video from our former Principal Ms Pamela Yoong which included her well-wishes to the Class of 2022. Civics Tutors then distributed the results to the individual students. 

Our heartiest congratulations to the Class of 2022 for your achievements. As a cohort, we celebrate together and at the same time look out for one another. 
TMJC is very proud of each and every one of you.

### JC1 Orientation 2023: AURORA

On 3 February 2023, TMJC kicked off the JC1 Orientation with the theme “AURORA” to receive our 6th batch of students. The theme came to live as the Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) welcomed the incoming JC1 students into our TMJC family. “AURORA” refers to dawn, the beginning of a new phenomenon. Similarly, Orientation symbolises a new beginning of the students’ journey in TMJC. As the JC1 students work hard to achieve their goals, they will eventually attain holistic excellence, like the beautiful array of “AURORA”.

On Day 1, the students were welcomed with a series of informative Academic Subject Talks and a dialogue with School Leaders and Academic Heads that provided an avenue for students to gain deeper understanding of the academic demands and rigour of the various subject disciplines. Day 1 ended memorably as our OGLs wore their secondary school uniforms and surprised our JC1 students with a spectacular flash mob of the 2023 College Mass Dance Performance.

Subsequently, the oncoming days shed light on TMJC’s strong College spirit, dynamic culture, and vibrant student experiences. Day 2 started off with a significant Opening Ceremony which included the revelation of our Orientation banner and 5 new House banners, and impressive House walk-in dances that the OGLs had trained for months to passionately showcase to our JC1 students. A series of icebreakers and team bonding games were designed to facilitate new friendships. Additionally, the OGLs served as College Tour Ambassadors and passionately introduced our College venues and facilities to the JC1 students.

On Day 3, the quest continued as the JC1 students participated in numerous Internal Games that were curated to share the importance of our College values. The JC1 students also learnt the 2023 College Mass Dance enthusiastically. The song was specially selected to induct the students into our TMJC family and reinforce the understanding that we will be stronger as one family.

On Day 4, the OGLs demonstrated TMJC’s breathtaking house spirit as they taught the JC1 students the unique cheers that belonged to the 5 Houses. In addition, the JC2 CCA Leaders inspired our JC1 students with the iconic CCA Leaders’ Walk-in and Oath Taking Ceremony. The day ended with a meaningful JC1 CCA Recruitment Exercise and CCA Booth Exhibition where our CCA Leaders shared their vibrant CCA life in TMJC, and the unique experiences their CCAs have to offer.

Day 5 brought the Orientation adventure to an exhilarating end as the OGLs brought the JC1 students to Pasir Ris Park for an enriching time of fun and bonding through games. The JC1 students experienced the climax of the Orientation Programme as they watched the myriad of live Finale House and CCA performances that were uniquely designed to inspire the students with our exuberant College Spirit. The JC1 Orientation ended on a high note as the OGLs and JC1 students sang the College Anthem with pride and joy.

All in all, our JC1 students enjoyed the Orientation Programme, grew in character, and became a part of the TMJC family. Our JC2 OGLs also rose to the challenge of inducting their juniors  and demonstrated their love and dedication to TMJC. Welcome to TMJC, JC1s!

### 4PM Ministerial Dialogue 2023

Our JC 2 Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) students were honoured to be invited to the 4PM Ministerial Dialogue 2023, a youth-led dialogue that empowers youths on issues relating to Singapore policies and development. On 28 January 2023, the JC 2 MLEP students engaged in a dialogue session with Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security, Mr Teo Chee Hean. He shared with the students the importance of values in forging diplomatic ties between countries. The recent happenings of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and tensions between US-China relationship were some examples he quoted. SM Teo responded to various questions from the participants such as Singapore’s approach to deal with radicalism. He shared his experiences of visiting other countries such as France and Dubai to learn about their strategies in countering radicalism. Our students have benefitted and gained much meaningful insight from this dialogue.

### Taekwondo and Wushu Performance at Pasir Ris Elias Community Club 

Our Taekwondo and Wushu teams performed at the Pasir Ris Elias Community Club Chinese New Year performance on 28 January 2023. We are indeed honoured and happy to join the Pasir Ris residents to celebrate this festival. The students in the CCAs put up a memorable performance, showcasing their focus and discipline in their respective martial arts forms. Through the performances, we joyfully ushered in the prosperous year of the Rabbit.

### Chinese New Year Celebrations 2023

On 20 January, TMJC ushered in the Lunar New Year of the Rabbit with celebratory activities, revolving around the theme of “Return of Spring and A New Year of Vitality”.  
  
The programme started with CGs displaying their creativity by making CNY handicraft using red packets. The handicraft consisted of lanterns, firecrackers and new year greeting cards which were displayed along the study area outside the General Office, adding cheer to the festive mood.

![](/images/Event%20Highlights/2023/Term%201/CNY%20Celebrations/2023-T1-Events-CNYCelebrations_01.jpg)

Students also watched a student-directed short film produced by the Citizenship Education Committee, highlighting the different symbolic meanings of Rabbit in Asian countries. This was followed by an inter-CG Kahoot Quiz to heighten students’ awareness of the citizenship messages behind the film.  
  
The second segment of the programme gathered all teachers and students in the Hall for a kaleidoscope of performances put up by various CCA groups. Students from the Chinese Orchestra, Choir, Modern Dance, Wushu and Taekwondo staged performances of celebratory music, songs, dance and martial arts, heightening the festive cheer. Teachers Ms Ann Koh and Mr Wong Hoe Sing also added to the festive cheer with their live song performances. As part of the Lunar New Year tradition, the student leaders presented mandarin oranges to our school leaders and staff to express their gratitude and appreciation.

### TMJC Open House 2023

On 13 January 2023, TMJC held our first post COVID-19 Open House to welcome visitors.&nbsp;  

TM Wonderland, the theme for Open House 2023, aimed to create unique experiences for visitors by infusing magical, whimsical elements into our programmes and activities.  
  
Our Principal, Mr Sin Kim Ho, provided insight into the JC curriculum that enabled our visitors to gain a deeper understanding of their new and exciting journey ahead.  
  
The subject talks and booths set up by our dedicated staff gave prospective students a glimpse of our TMJC programmes.  
  
In addition, our committed students came together to set up informative CCA booths and put together rousing performances during the CCA showcase, Opening and Closing ceremonies. It was indeed a magical day where visitors experienced our strong College spirit and dynamic culture.  
  
TM Wonderland ended memorably with a group shot of our staff, students and visitors at the College hall to commemorate this significant day.  
  
Thank you for being a part of TM Wonderland!

One of the highlights of the day was the&nbsp;“Staff&nbsp;vs Student Challenge”&nbsp;where students from 5 different Houses held friendly competitions with their teachers in various activities. This was a great opportunity for students to catch their teachers in action outside the classroom.
