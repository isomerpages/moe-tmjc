<h3>TM Connects 2025</h3>
<p>TM Connects, a community awareness event organised by the TMJC Values
in Action (VIA) Committee, was held on 28 Feb 2025. This year, we had a
total of 21 organisations participating in the event, which included talks
as well as informative and experiential booths to engage our JC1 students.
Five JC2 student groups also took the opportunity to showcase their VIA
projects, as they looked to encourage their juniors to continue the various
community service efforts. We express our gratitude to our partner organisations
and the various JC2 students for enthusiastically sharing insights on service
learning with our JC1s and inspiring them to serve the community.
<br>
<br>Through TM Connects, we hope that our students can develop an understanding
of various community issues, explore areas of interest, and select organisations
they wish to serve. We look forward to seeing our students actively strive
to enact positive changes within the community.</p>

<h3>Commemorating 41 years of Total Defence</h3>
<p>The College commemorated 41 years of Total Defence Day under the theme
“Together, We Keep Singapore Strong”. Amid crises and disruptions such
as geopolitical and geoeconomic developments that impact Singapore, the
significance of Total Defence remains ever relevant. The focus of the commemoration
was thus on preparing students to respond to potential disruptions, in
particular food supply disruptions.
<br>
<br>Apart from student reflection on the national and personal importance
of Total Defence during their CCE lessons, two highlights stand out. On
14 February, the JC1s participated in an experiential learning journey
to Nippon Koi Farm to gain a better understanding of how Singapore uses
technology such as nanoengineering and titanium technology to enhance her
food security, a key aspect of our Economic Defence. In the process, they
also forged deeper ties with one another. On 28 February, the commemoration
concluded on an impactful note. Our canteen vendors supported our Total
Defence efforts by offering only two dishes or meal options to simulate
limited food choices in emergency situations.</p>

<h3>JC1 Badge Pinning Ceremony 2025</h3>
<p>TMJC held our annual JC1 Badge Pinning Ceremony on 24 February 2025. This
ceremony symbolised the start of the JC1s' journey at TMJC, and the involvement
of the JC2s was a reflection of the support that they would receive, as
both cohorts forge ahead as one TMJC student body.
<br>
<br>During the ceremony, the CG Chairpersons and Peer Support Leaders from
each JC2 class presented the College collar pins to their JC1 juniors,
warmly welcoming them into the TMJC family. The JC2 seniors also shared
valuable words of advice and personal experiences, offering guidance on
what truly matters as the JC1s embark on their two-year journey. As the
JC1s proudly pinned on their College collar pins together as a cohort,
it marked the official beginning of their exciting and fulfilling journey
ahead.
<br>
<br>Welcome JC1s!</p>

<h3>TMJC STEM Week 2025: STEM in our Lives</h3>
<p>The recently concluded STEM Week 2025 between 12 – 19 Feb was a second
iteration of the event first inaugurated last year. Jointly organised by
the Science and Mathematics Departments, this event continued to showcase
to our students the relevance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics
in our daily lives. The week-long programme featured diverse "islands"
of learning, including engaging talks, hands-on workshops, and enlightening
learning journeys. JC1 students could choose from a series of presentations
by their JC2 seniors, alumni, and staff members, covering a range of topics
from immunology to String Theory.
<br>
<br>Popular workshops provided practical insights into scientific concepts.
The "Brewed Chemistry: The Science Behind Coffee" session delved into the
intricate processes behind our favourite morning beverage. Biology enthusiasts
extracted DNA from strawberries, while mathematics sleuths explored the
fascinating world of Platonic solids and even forensic science. Our college
STEM instructors also supported the conduct of various activities, and
were also involved in helming a workshop, bringing their expertise directly
to the students.
<br>
<br>Learning journeys offered students real-world perspectives on STEM applications.
A highlight was the visit to the Science Centre, where students experienced
"Space Explorers: THE INFINITE", an immersive VR journey to the International
Space Station. Other visits to 3M Technologies, and Singapore Maritime
Gallery provided students with real-world perspectives on STEM applications
and related industries.
<br>
<br>Other discovery activities, such as creating thaumatropes and exploring
DIY lab-in-a-bag kits encouraged hands-on learning and creativity. Posters
highlighted how STEM permeates many aspects of our everyday lives, while
contests such as the “Guesstimate” showcase challenged students' estimation
skills. The week culminated in an eventful paper airplane competition,
with students applying their understanding of aerodynamics and design principles
in a spirit of friendly competition.
<br>
<br>STEM Week not only celebrated the wonders of science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics but also inspired our students to consider how these disciplines
and relevant industries shape our world and influence our daily lives.</p>

<h3>Chinese New Year Celebrations 2025</h3>
<p>The 2025 Lunar New Year celebrations at Tampines Meridian Junior College
(TMJC) took place on 28 January, bringing the college community together
in a joyous and meaningful event. With the theme “Spring in Tampines Meridian,”
the festivities embraced the spirit of new beginnings, gratitude, and unity.
<br>
<br>The celebrations commenced with all JC2 students engaging in a Spring
Cleaning activity as part of the TM Sparkles Community Program. This initiative
reinforced the value of social responsibility, as students worked together
to clean various facilities in the College. More than just a practical
task, this symbolic act reflected the tradition of bidding farewell to
the old and welcoming new beginnings—a key theme of the Lunar New Year.
<br>
<br>Following the Spring Cleaning session, the college community gathered
in the Hall for an exciting array of performances by various CCA groups.
Students from the Chinese Orchestra, Guitar Ensemble, Taekwondo, Modern
Dance, and Wushu took the stage, captivating the audience with a dynamic
showcase of music, dance, and martial arts that heightened the festive
spirit.

Ong Yan Lin, Mr Lim Khoon Liang, and Mr Nicholas Chua took center stage
to lead the performers in a heartwarming rendition of traditional Lunar
New Year melodies, filling the hall with joy and camaraderie.
<br>
<br>The concert reached a thrilling climax with an electrifying Lion Dance
performance by NUS Lion Dance, a highlight of the celebration. As the lions
leaped and twirled across the stage, they presented auspicious New Year
couplets to Mr Sin Kim Ho, Principal of TMJC, and Mr Nelson Chua, Chairman
of the College Advisory Committee. The crowd erupted in cheers, embracing
the blessings of good fortune and prosperity.
<br>
<br>Continuing a cherished Lunar New Year tradition, student leaders presented
mandarin oranges to school leaders and staff, expressing their gratitude
and appreciation for their guidance and dedication. This simple yet heartfelt
gesture reinforced the values of respect and unity within the TMJC family.
The celebrations concluded on a high note with a college-wide Lo-Hei session,
a tradition symbolizing abundance, prosperity, and shared aspirations for
the year ahead. As students and staff tossed the ingredients high into
the air, laughter and well-wishes filled the room, marking the perfect
end to a meaningful and joyous Lunar New Year celebration.

<p>9 students from our College participated in the <a href="http://OnePeople.SG" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OnePeople.sg</a> Model United Nations from 3-6
December 2024. Instead of focussing primarily on UN functions, students

issues in Singapore. Our students took on the roles of local agencies and
government bodies to discuss hot button issues pertaining to race relations,
and worked towards consensus building. It is noteworthy that our students,
Yew Shang Hong and Riddhimaa Rampuria were accorded the Outstanding Delegate
award for the council they represented. Overall, our students had an enriching

<h3>Open House 2025</h3>
<p>On 11 January, we hosted our Open House, inviting visitors to explore,
discover and immerse in the unique TMJC experience. Aligned with our theme,
Skye’s Story, our Principal, Mr Sin, alumnus and current students engaged
in a dialogue session about different aspects of the JC curriculum and
the journey that a TMJCian goes through during their two-year stay. Through
