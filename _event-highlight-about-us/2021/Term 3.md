### JC1 National Service (NS) Engagement Talk and Sharing on a Career with the Armed Forces

On the afternoon of 1 September 2021, the Ministry of Education, in collaboration with the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Home Affairs, invited the Central Manpower Base (CMPB) to conduct a National Service (NS) Engagement Talk with our male JC1 students. The session aimed to help our students better understand the enlistment process for National Service, so that they may start preparing themselves mentally and physically for NS.

In addition to the sharing of the pre-enlistment processes by CMPB, we were also very happy to have our alumni, Lewis Kwek Boon Leong (TPJC 16S21) and Teo Guang Long (MJC 14S301), to join us for the session to share their NS experiences with our students. Female students who were keen to learn more about a career in the armed forces were also engaged in a separate sharing session by the Army and Navy Recruitment Centre, where they learnt more about what life as a female regular in the armed forces entails.

We hope that these talks can prepare our students for their life beyond TMJC, as they look ahead and begin to make plans and preparation for their future.

Teachers’ Day Celebration 2021
------------------------------

  
TMJC celebrated Teachers’ Day early on 27th Aug, allowing both the J1 and J2 students to celebrate the hard work and “heart” work of all TMJC staff.The theme for this year’s Teachers’ Day Celebration is **_Hope._** This theme was specially chosen by our students as they felt it encapsulated all that the school leaders, teachers and support staff have done for them. Our school leaders have always stood by our students, giving them hope even when the going gets tough. Our teachers are constantly encouraging and motivating the students to stay hopeful as they work towards their goals. And without the support staff providing a conducive environment for their learning, the students would not have been able to stay hopeful and press on this far. Indeed, it was a heart-warming and fun-filled morning of activities for students to show their deepest appreciation to everyone who has given them **_hope_**.  
  
Beyond the celebration with students, staff was also treated to a sumptuous staff lunch, with drinks generously sponsored by our Parents Support Group.  
  
Our Principal, Ms Yoong, also dedicated the following modified poem to the teachers of TMJC:  

  
**A Teacher’s Poem**

Every day you greet your students with a smile on your face. <br>
Though paperwork the night before seemed like a grueling race.  

Money’s not your motivation, it’s the love for what you do. <br>
You hear the special calling to which you always will stay true.  
  
Your students are your dedication - your devotion to them.  <br>
To you, each child’s unique and special, a beautiful gem.  
  
Some days are just demanding and frustration takes its course.  <br>
Then you see those faces, their inspiration is your force.  
  
Each day you are in your classroom reminds you why you are there.  <br>
Making differences in young lives with whom your heart you share.  
  
There’s a special pride in teachers, and a love for what you do.  <br>
And appreciation’s always shared between those young lives and you.  
  
Wishing all TMJC staff a Happy Teacher's Day!
