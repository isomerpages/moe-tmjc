### JC1 National Service (NS) Engagement Talk and Sharing on a Career with the Armed Forces

On the afternoon of 1 September 2021, the Ministry of Education, in collaboration with the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Home Affairs, invited the Central Manpower Base (CMPB) to conduct a National Service (NS) Engagement Talk with our male JC1 students. The session aimed to help our students better understand the enlistment process for National Service, so that they may start preparing themselves mentally and physically for NS.

In addition to the sharing of the pre-enlistment processes by CMPB, we were also very happy to have our alumni, Lewis Kwek Boon Leong (TPJC 16S21) and Teo Guang Long (MJC 14S301), to join us for the session to share their NS experiences with our students. Female students who were keen to learn more about a career in the armed forces were also engaged in a separate sharing session by the Army and Navy Recruitment Centre, where they learnt more about what life as a female regular in the armed forces entails.

We hope that these talks can prepare our students for their life beyond TMJC, as they look ahead and begin to make plans and preparation for their future.

  

### Presentation of Professional Development (PD) Recognition Certificates

On 24 and 25 August, Ms Yoong presented recognition certificates to teachers from the General Paper department for their contributions to the fraternity through CPDD’s GP Professional Inquiry (PI). The team of teachers were led by Senior Teacher Conrad Lee, with Lead Teacher Jasmine Kum as advisor, and members Geraldine Tan, Thangaraj Pradeepa, John Jude Alexander, and Geraldine Sim. The team presented their research on the topic “Examining the Effect of Mentor Texts on A Level Essay Writing Skills”.

### Teachers’ Day Celebration 2021

TMJC celebrated Teachers’ Day early on 27th Aug, allowing both the J1 and J2 students to celebrate the hard work and “heart” work of all TMJC staff.The theme for this year’s Teachers’ Day Celebration is **_Hope._** This theme was specially chosen by our students as they felt it encapsulated all that the school leaders, teachers and support staff have done for them. Our school leaders have always stood by our students, giving them hope even when the going gets tough. Our teachers are constantly encouraging and motivating the students to stay hopeful as they work towards their goals. And without the support staff providing a conducive environment for their learning, the students would not have been able to stay hopeful and press on this far. Indeed, it was a heart-warming and fun-filled morning of activities for students to show their deepest appreciation to everyone who has given them **_hope_**.  
  
Beyond the celebration with students, staff was also treated to a sumptuous staff lunch, with drinks generously sponsored by our Parents Support Group.  
  
Our Principal, Ms Yoong, also dedicated the following modified poem to the teachers of TMJC:  

  
**A Teacher’s Poem**

Every day you greet your students with a smile on your face. <br>
Though paperwork the night before seemed like a grueling race.  

Money’s not your motivation, it’s the love for what you do. <br>
You hear the special calling to which you always will stay true.  
  
Your students are your dedication - your devotion to them.  <br>
To you, each child’s unique and special, a beautiful gem.  
  
Some days are just demanding and frustration takes its course.  <br>
Then you see those faces, their inspiration is your force.  
  
Each day you are in your classroom reminds you why you are there.  <br>
Making differences in young lives with whom your heart you share.  
  
There’s a special pride in teachers, and a love for what you do.  <br>
And appreciation’s always shared between those young lives and you.  
  
Wishing all TMJC staff a Happy Teacher's Day!

### National Day Celebrations & TM Celebrates!
  
On 6 August, TMJC celebrated her third anniversary alongside Singapore's 56th birthday! To mark this special day, the College put together a unique programme that was safe, engaging, and meaningful under the twin themes “Together, Our Singapore Spirit” and “Be Better Together.”  
After the special National Day Observance Ceremony that included immersive video snippets of the upcoming National Day Parade rehearsal, students participated in innovative peer-designed games at the CG and inter-house levels. These educational games were played within classes to minimise intermingling and students learnt about interesting facts surrounding the history and culture of Singapore and the College.  
  
As part of the finale, every CG Chairperson flew a CG-designed paper plane in the parade square to symbolise reaching new heights together amid the pandemic. Each CG then contributed a piece of jigsaw puzzle that came together in an in-house student-designed jigsaw mural showcasing the vibrant CCA culture of TMJC.  
  
The close of the celebrations featured other key highlights of the combined celebrations. This included the launch of the College Digital Clock which symbolises the unity of the TMJC family through good and bad times. Finally, there was the launch of student-designed College keepsakes, such as the Tote Bag and other limited edition stationeries like the L-shaped file and post-it pads designed by our students. With every celebration there will be food; students were treated to delicious Krispy Kreme doughnuts and refreshing Vitamin Drink.  
  
Happy Birthday, Singapore! Happy Birthday, TMJC!

### Fastest Fingers Graphing Calculator Competition

For several years running, TMJC has been the organiser for the Inter-school Fastest Fingers Graphing Calculator Competition (FFGCC). This year, 51 participants from 10 schools battled their way for a spot in the finals that was held on 4th August 2021. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, this is also the first time that the competition is held online, where various ICT platforms are used to support the format of the competition, without compromising on the learning and integrity of competition. It was held successfully, and it received positive feedback from teachers and participants.  
  
Five schools, namely, ACJC, DHS, NYJC, RI and TMJC, made it to the finals and we are proud to announce that the team from TMJC, comprising Nguyen Xuan Nam (20S101), Run Xinghuan (20S101), Gordon Tay Zhun Xiang (20S202) and Chan Wei Ning (20S202) came in 4th after putting up a tough fight.

### Racial Harmony Day Commemoration 2021  
  
This year's Racial Harmony Day (RHD) Commemoration commenced on 21 July with the theme 'Singapore's Multiculturalism at a Crossroads'. The 3-part commemoration sought to help students appreciate Singapore’s fragile racial harmony on a deeper level through being aware of milestones in race relations and recent developments that have threatened to derail it.  
  
Part 1 was a RHD-themed TikTok Competition held in collaboration with the Modern Dance Society that enthused students in celebrating Singapore’s racial harmony through dance, a cultural cornerstone.  
  
Part 2 consisted of a virtual experiential gallery tour that was broadcasted on 21 and 22 July during morning assembly. The Citizenship Education Committee collaborated with The Red Marker to create an immersive 3D virtual tour that charted Singapore’s arduous journey towards fostering a multicultural identity.  
  
Part 3 comprised a call-to-action during the follow-up CCE lesson, where students reflected on their implicit racial bias as a crucial first step towards combating racism. They also learnt how to talk about race in a thoughtful and sensitive manner, a matter of vital importance in the age of social media where tensions are easily inflamed.  
  
Through these activities, we hope that students will develop a renewed sense of purpose to protect Singapore’s multicultural harmony.

### National Olympiad in Informatics 2021

On 20th March 2021, two of our JC1 students, Le Tu Quoc Dat and Nguyen Anh Duc from 21S101, participated in the Singapore National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI), organised by National University of Singapore, School of Computing.  
  
NOI is a competition modelled after the International Olympiad in Informatics, the ultimate international competition in computing. With the aim to equip students with knowledge beyond that of a mere IT application user, in line with our national goal of creating an IT-savvy nation, NOI emphasises creativity in problem solving on the one hand, and programming skill and expertise on the other.  
  
We are pleased to share that Le Tu Quoc Dat (21S101) has been awarded the Silver award for this competition.  
  
Well done, students!

### Parents Engagement Webinar - Raising a Resilient Teen

On the evening of 16th July 2021, the College organised a Parents Engagement Webinar on the topic of “Raising a Resilient Teen”. The session aimed to provide parents of our students with tips on how to help their child grow from the unique challenges presented at the JC level and to build resilience.  
  
For the keynote address, our College invited Ms. Wendy Chua, a psychologist, founder, and managing director of WAND INSPIRATION, and a mother of four children, to share with us her expertise and experience in working with adolescents. Together with Ms. Chua, Mdm Aslindah, Head of TMJC’s English Department and a mother of two teenage sons, and Ms. Naseemah Khan, an alumnus of TMJC, were the panelists for the forum panel discussion,  where they shared their unique perspectives on how parents can support their children in developing a growth mindset and how to keep communication channels open.  
  
We thank all parents who joined us for a meaningful evening. The College looks forward to forging stronger partnerships with parents in our collective efforts towards developing our students holistically.
