### TM Sparkles

![](/images/2021-T1-Events-TMSparkles_01.jpeg)

TM Sparkles is a College-wide effort to encourage TMJC students to take responsibility of the cleanliness of venues they use frequently.  This is in line with the Keep Singapore Clean Movement (KSCM) in Schools.

TM Sparkles aims to open eyes, change minds and inspire the hearts of our TMJC students using a two-pronged approach:

1.  CG duty roster to promote daily clean-up

2. CG College clean-up regularly with the school attendants to show gratitude and appreciation to them

Through TM Sparkles, we hope to instil in our students, acts of civic-mindedness and social responsibility in keeping our community clean.

To ensure a smooth running of TM Sparkles, a pilot run was conducted on 12 March, Friday, from 2.30pm to 4.30pm by our JC2 student leaders: JC2 Student Councillors, JC2 CG Chairpersons and JC2 Peer Support Leaders. They were assigned areas to clean up and had the chance to work closely with the school attendants.

### TM Run 2021
  
Every year, our College organises a run for all staff and students to promote physical activity and a healthy lifestyle. Last year, due to the escalating COVID-19 situation, the College-wide run was replaced by a CG-level run during their Physical Education (PE) lessons.  
  
In 2021, undaunted by the challenges, the College came together to organise a College-wide run on 10 March. To prepare for the run, student competitors had been training diligently during PE lessons, and fellow classmates also showed their support by training alongside them as a form of camaraderie. In light of the logistical needs of the event that has to accommodate safe distancing measures and to ensure safety, students and staff readily volunteered to help out in various areas such as first aid, to be ushers, to be road marshals,  to assist with registration and to be transition zone referees.  
  
TM Run is indeed testament to our College’s ability to adapt and shine through adversity!

### JC1 Parent Teacher Engagement

On 5th March 2021, TMJC hosted our first digital JC1 Parent Teacher Engagement (PTE) in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents, teachers, and students were digitally connected from their respective homes in the evening.  
  
The purpose of PTE is to foster a strong partnership with parents to provide support for their child’s academic studies as well as their character development in TMJC.  
  
In the first segment, we had a Webinar with our Principal, Ms Pamela Yoong, Vice-Principal overseeing JC1, Mr Ang Yeou Peng and JC1 Year Head, Mrs Sze-Seah Chai Ju sharing on the various aspects of the JC curriculum in TMJC to the parents. Mrs Agnes Teo, Head of Arts & Aesthetics/Partnership then shared the MOE Partnership Framework and a video of Mr Ahamed Ali Khan, a parent of our alumnus Naseemah D/O Ahamed Ali Khan (19A302) sharing some tips with the parents on how they may support their child in their JC journey. Parents were then encouraged to join our TMJC Parent Support Group. Questions from parents were also addressed in the Zoom chat.

The second segment were CG-based sessions that allowed parents the opportunity to be introduced to their child’s Civics Tutors via Zoom. Civics Tutors shared with parents essential information such as the contact information of their child’s Subject Tutors, key dates to be noted in the College Calendar, CCA matters and some tips on how parents and Civics Tutor can partner together to support their child.  
  
Borrowing the African proverb, ‘it takes a village to raise a child’, the College thus looks forward to a strong collaboration with our students’ parents for their holistic development.

### TM Connects 2021

TM Connects is a community awareness event organised by the TMJC Values-In-Action Committee. The theme for TM Connects 2021 is “Opening Minds, Impacting Lives”.  
  
Through TM Connects, we hope students can gain awareness and have a better understanding of different community issues, explore areas of interest and choose the organisations that they would like to serve. Thereafter, we hope TMJC students can seek to bring about positive change to the community.  
  
We thank our partners who have shared enthusiastically with our students via a virtual platform during the session!  
_Due to the current Covid-19 situation, TM Connects 2021 was carried out virtually on_ _5 March 2021 from 2.30pm to 5pm via Zoom._

### JC1 Initiation Ceremony

On 22 February 2021, the College held our annual JC1 Initiation Ceremony. This Ceremony is another TMJC tradition that the College has established despite being a young College. The ceremony is intended to symbolise the seniors welcoming the juniors and the journeying together of the JC1s and JC2s as they move ahead together as one TMJC student body.  

  
During the ceremony, that took place across various venues due to Safe Management Measures, CG Chairpersons and Peer Support Leaders from each JC2 class presented the College collar pins to their JC1 juniors, to welcome them to the TMJC family. The JC1s then proudly put on their College collar pins, to signify them embracing and being part of the TMJC family officially.

### Total Defence Day Commemoration 2021
  
TMJC commemorated Total Defence Day (TDD) from 17 to 24 February 2021 under the theme “Together, We Keep Singapore Stronger”. Introduced in 1984 to mark the day Singapore fell to Japanese troops in 1942, the annual TDD Commemoration exhorts every Singaporean to play their part to keep Singapore safe, secure and independent. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the significance of Total Defence becomes more pronounced. Social cohesion is imperative to successfully battle the virus. In light of this, during their Character & Citizenship Education lessons, students learnt about recent developments that undermined Singapore’s ability to overcome the pandemic. These include lax adherence to Safe Management Measures among some, the bystander effect and fake news regarding vaccines. They also learnt about the significant role they can play in fostering Psychological and Digital Defence in the community. The commemoration culminated in a Wall Art Display outside the General Office with students’ pledges as part of the design. We were honoured by Ms Ranjit Kaur, our Cluster Superintendent, who graced the occasion. The Wall Display functions as a daily visual reminder to all TMJC students on the importance of being ‘Stronger Together’ to combat COVID-19.

### Release of GCE A-Level Examination Results

On 19th February 2021, our JC3s returned to college to receive their GCE A-Level Examinations results.  
  
With the current ongoing pandemic, our seniors cooperated well with the necessary Safe Management Measures in place to ensure a smooth collection process as we welcomed them warmly back to our campus.

![](/images/2021-T1-Events-ALevelResults_01.jpeg)

The decentralised collections at the various classrooms began with a sharing by Ms Jacqueline Tan (Subject Head, Education and Career Guidance) on the pathways post-JC education, and the various support the College is providing to support the students in their decision-making and application processes. Subsequently, our Principal, Ms Pamela Yoong, shared the achievements of the 2019-2020 Cohort via a live broadcast. With anticipations escalating, Civic Tutors then distributed the results to individual students.

As they plan their next step, may we wish our JC3s a wonderful journey ahead filled with courage and resilience. Our heartiest congratulations to you for your stellar results. TMJC is very proud of you!

### Tree Planting Ceremony 2021

On 19th February 2021, TMJC held our 2nd Tree-Planting Ceremony. It represents a new beginning for the Class of 2020 as they graduate from College, whilst leaving fond memories deeply etched to the grounds of the College.  
The Tree-Planting Ceremony is a tradition TMJC started in 2020, as it commemorates the shared experiences and achievements of each cohort of students.  

  
The tembusu tree which was chosen to be planted, is a large, evergreen tree that matures with stately beauty, and can provide shelter for all. It is highly robust and can grow in almost any type of soil, testifying to its resilience. Such attributes symbolise the values and character that the College hopes to imbue in TMJC students.  
  
This ceremony was led by the School Leaders, together with student representatives from the 2019-2020 Student Council:  Naseemah D/O Ahamed Ali Khan (19A302/ President), Vaishalika Jain (19A202/ Vice-President); Chantal Poh Cheng Hoon (19A201 / Vice President) and Sivalogamoorthy Shrikeesan (19S212/ Vice President).

### TMJC Chinese New Year Celebrations 2021

On 11 February 2021, the TMJC family celebrated the arrival of the Chinese New Year. The festive celebration consisted of two components.  
  
The first component, “Understanding the Uniqueness of Singapore’s Chinese Culture via the Lens of the Chinese Diaspora”, is anchored in Citizenship Education. It aims to foster national pride in our students and to highlight Singapore’s unique Chinese culture amidst the threat of cultural dilution wrought by globalisation. In this segment, a 30-minute student-directed mini-film, consisting of 3 parts: Looking Back, Looking Out, Looking Forward, was screened and broadcasted to various venues.

The second component of the celebration offered challenges to the JC1 and JC2 Civic Groups (CG) titled “The Plum Blossom Challenge” and “The Lantern Making Challenge” respectively.  In the first challenge, each JC1 CG had to complete five tasks related to the Chinese New Year, and prizes were given to the top 5 CGs who completed the tasks in the shortest time. For the JC2s, each CG had to make lanterns using red packets which were later hung on display within the college premises. Similarly, the 5 CGs with the most creatively designed lanterns won prizes.

Despite all faces covered by masks due to the pandemic, the joyous expressions and emotions shone through brightly. The event ended in high spirits with the School Leaders completing the Plum Blossom Tree with the “Plum Blossoms”.  
  
Have an Oxpicious Year!

### Chinese New Year Celebrations with our International Scholars

  
On 11 February 2021, TMJC gathered our international scholars to exchange well wishes for the Lunar New Year. Given the global pandemic, our international students were unable to return to their home countries to celebrate the Lunar New Year with their families nor have their families visit them in Singapore. To help make the festive season meaningful for them nevertheless, our 24 JC2 scholars and 26 JC1 scholars met our Principal, Ms Yoong, to exchange well wishes. During the session, Ms Yoong shared words of blessings to them on behalf of the College, and each of the student then shared words of blessings in their native languages to Ms Yoong, who symbolically received the words of blessings on behalf of the College.

### Staff Professional Development Day 2

TMJC’s Staff Professional Development Day 2 focuses on the principles of sound e-pedagogy, as Singapore schools gear up for the implementation of Blended Learning. After a keynote sharing on the “Whats” and “Hows” of effective E-Pedagogy, capped by an exciting Kahoot quiz, teachers also had the opportunity to have hands-on practice on ICT tools such as the new features of Student Learning Space (SLS), Google Classroom, and Powtoons.

### CCA, Modern Dance's Participation in the Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC IAEC Virtual Deepavali Celebrations 2020

On 28 November last year, our CCA, Modern Dance, was invited to put up a dance performance for the Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC Virtual Deepavali Celebrations, where Senior Minister & Coordinating Minister for National Security, Mr Teo Chee Hean was the Guest-of-Honour.

  
This was an important event for the residents to come together to celebrate this festival and enhance the mood of celebration amongst our residents of Pasir Ris and Punggol. To thank our dancers for being part of this, the organisers have thus presented the College a Certificate of Appreciation for our involvement.

  
On 8 February 2021, Kelly Tan Jing Ying (20S303) and Camille Chua Yu En (20S101) therefore represented the dancers in presenting the Certificate of Appreciation to our Principal, Ms Yoong. The dancers thanked Ms Yoong for her support and having provided them the opportunity to perform for this meaningful virtual celebration.   
Good job, dancers, for your service to our community!
