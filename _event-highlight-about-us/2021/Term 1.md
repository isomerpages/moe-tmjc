### TM Sparkles

![](/images/2021-T1-Events-TMSparkles_01.jpeg)

TM Sparkles is a College-wide effort to encourage TMJC students to take responsibility of the cleanliness of venues they use frequently.  This is in line with the Keep Singapore Clean Movement (KSCM) in Schools.

TM Sparkles aims to open eyes, change minds and inspire the hearts of our TMJC students using a two-pronged approach:

1.  CG duty roster to promote daily clean-up

2. CG College clean-up regularly with the school attendants to show gratitude and appreciation to them

Through TM Sparkles, we hope to instil in our students, acts of civic-mindedness and social responsibility in keeping our community clean.

To ensure a smooth running of TM Sparkles, a pilot run was conducted on 12 March, Friday, from 2.30pm to 4.30pm by our JC2 student leaders: JC2 Student Councillors, JC2 CG Chairpersons and JC2 Peer Support Leaders. They were assigned areas to clean up and had the chance to work closely with the school attendants.

### TM Run 2021
  
Every year, our College organises a run for all staff and students to promote physical activity and a healthy lifestyle. Last year, due to the escalating COVID-19 situation, the College-wide run was replaced by a CG-level run during their Physical Education (PE) lessons.  
  
In 2021, undaunted by the challenges, the College came together to organise a College-wide run on 10 March. To prepare for the run, student competitors had been training diligently during PE lessons, and fellow classmates also showed their support by training alongside them as a form of camaraderie. In light of the logistical needs of the event that has to accommodate safe distancing measures and to ensure safety, students and staff readily volunteered to help out in various areas such as first aid, to be ushers, to be road marshals,  to assist with registration and to be transition zone referees.  
  
TM Run is indeed testament to our College’s ability to adapt and shine through adversity!

### JC1 Parent Teacher Engagement

On 5th March 2021, TMJC hosted our first digital JC1 Parent Teacher Engagement (PTE) in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents, teachers, and students were digitally connected from their respective homes in the evening.  
  
The purpose of PTE is to foster a strong partnership with parents to provide support for their child’s academic studies as well as their character development in TMJC.  
  
In the first segment, we had a Webinar with our Principal, Ms Pamela Yoong, Vice-Principal overseeing JC1, Mr Ang Yeou Peng and JC1 Year Head, Mrs Sze-Seah Chai Ju sharing on the various aspects of the JC curriculum in TMJC to the parents. Mrs Agnes Teo, Head of Arts & Aesthetics/Partnership then shared the MOE Partnership Framework and a video of Mr Ahamed Ali Khan, a parent of our alumnus Naseemah D/O Ahamed Ali Khan (19A302) sharing some tips with the parents on how they may support their child in their JC journey. Parents were then encouraged to join our TMJC Parent Support Group. Questions from parents were also addressed in the Zoom chat.

The second segment were CG-based sessions that allowed parents the opportunity to be introduced to their child’s Civics Tutors via Zoom. Civics Tutors shared with parents essential information such as the contact information of their child’s Subject Tutors, key dates to be noted in the College Calendar, CCA matters and some tips on how parents and Civics Tutor can partner together to support their child.  
  
Borrowing the African proverb, ‘it takes a village to raise a child’, the College thus looks forward to a strong collaboration with our students’ parents for their holistic development.
