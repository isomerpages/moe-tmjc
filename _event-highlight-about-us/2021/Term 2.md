### Student Leaders Retreat

In collaboration with Youth Inspired Consulting, TMJC's Student Leaders Retreat 2021 took place on 7 and 8 June 2021. In adherence to the Safe Management Measures, the Retreat was conducted over a virtual platform. During the Retreat, our newly elected JC1 student leaders were coached on the fundamentals of the 5 leadership practices in The Leadership Challenge as well as useful skills to carry out their duties and be more effective leaders. This was done through a series of exciting online experiential activities, such as online escape rooms and structured experiences, where they were constantly challenged to adapt to unforeseen circumstances and apply the 5 leadership practices. Through these activities, strong bonds and trust were built as a TMJC student leaders' community. Additionally, our student leaders engaged meaningfully in thought-provoking debates and authentic discussions in small breakout rooms. With the guidance from the facilitators from Youth Inspired Consulting and TMJC teachers, they crafted the vision and action plan for their respective teams.  
  
With a good foundation in the 5 leadership practices and strong support within the student leaders' community, our JC1 student leaders are now ready to take up the baton from their seniors and lead their peers confidently.  We wish them all the best in their leadership term!

### Staff Learning Symposium 2021

On 25 June, our teachers gathered online for our annual Staff Learning Symposium on a virtual platform. The Symposium continued the journey of our teachers in deepening our knowledge on Assessment for Learning practices, through tapping on the use of Chapter 4 in the book, Never Work Harder than Your Students by Robyn R. Jackson. In small breakout groups, our teachers delved into engaging discussions regarding how to proactively put in place support systems for learning in specific topics for their respective subjects.

In addition, our Economics and Mathematics Departments shared their department projects that they have embarked on for the year, which gave much food for thought for the rest of our teachers.

All in all, our teachers had a fruitful morning of collaborative professional development!   
  

### Election of Student Leaders

Just as how when one wave recedes, another rises to take its place, leadership renewal is an important and ongoing process in any organisation.  
  
Here at TMJC, we spent the past two months electing new student leaders to reinvigorate the Student Leadership body as part of our ongoing succession plan and leadership training.  The College holds the firm belief that every student has the potential to be a leader. Thus, every JC1 student is encouraged to take up the myriad of leadership opportunities available and embark on a journey of growth with support from teachers and peers.  
  
Those who stepped out of their comfort zones to become a student leader experienced a rigorous, fair and transparent selection process. Be it Civics Group Leaders, CCA Leaders or Student Councillors, each potential student leader went through interviews, campaigned for support, and voting by their peers. Peer Support Leaders also went through a nomination and interview process before being elected. This was to ensure that the fresh batch of leaders are capable and ready to take on their roles.  
  
We wish the newly elected student leaders of TMJC a meaningful and fruitful leadership experience as they lead and serve in their new role!

### Humanities Alive! 2021

Humanities Alive! is a series of Humanities-based enrichment activities organised by TMJC’s Humanities Department over the month of May. The theme for this inaugural year’s Humanities Alive! is “Crisis”. The objectives of Humanities Alive! are: to raise the awareness of the importance of Humanities, cultivate and develop passion for the Humanities, and allow students to learn more about themselves through the Humanities lens and what they can do to create a better world.

The series of enrichment activities comprise an instagram competition to allow TMJC students to share their perspectives and experiences of what ‘Crisis’ meant to them, a Speaker and Workshop series where distinguished guests were invited to share with students on various topics, original games crafted by J2 Humanities student volunteers meant to enable participants to appreciate the disciplines better, and creative expression sharings by our Literature studentsIn particular, the Speaker and Workshop Series, were of special mention. Our students had the privilege to engage with the following via virtual sessions on two separate days: Dr Victor R Savage, Adjunct Senior Fellow of S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies who shared about creating sustainability in the midst of crisis, focusing on the issue of COVID-19 pandemic; Dr Mustafa Izzuddin, Adjunct Senior Lecturer of National University of Singapore, also an alumni of our parent college TPJC, who provided insights into why ASEAN matters to South East Asia; celebrated Singapore writers Haresh Sharma, Alvin Pang, Marc Nair, and Akshita Nanda who shared about the different genres.


We are proud of the 45 student organisers and volunteers from 18 classes, who stepped up despite some not having leadership experiences, to lead in TMJC’s inaugural Humanities Alive! They were superb in adapting to ensure that the activities were carried out adhering to safe management requirements that evolved over the month of May when Humanities Alive! was carried out. We also thank the speakers who shared enthusiastically with the students and the Student Organising Committee and volunteers for leading the activities to make the event a meaningful and memorable one.

### Envisioning together with our TMJC Alumni!

On 10 April 2021, TMJC held its first virtual Alumni Envisioning meeting with 28 alumni who are ever so passionate and eager to serve the College.  
  
During the session, the alumni came together to envision how a strong College-Alumni partnership looks like, as well as its purpose. They also kick-started their discussions on three new alumni initiatives this year.  
  
The first initiative is led by Ng Jing Wen Amelia (18A301) and Clarinda Ong Kye Syin (18S211), where they plan to show the alumni's appreciation to their teachers for all their heart work and effort in guiding and supporting them throughout their A Level journey.  
  
The second initiative is led by Teo Jun Rui Jonathan (18S201), where he plans to show their alumni and current students' appreciation to the non-teaching staff in the College for all their hard work and dedication in working tirelessly behind the scenes to make TMJC a more conducive environment for learning.  
  
The third initiative is led by Heng Jee Xuen (19A301) and Medenilla Athena Joelle Saura (18S310), where they plan to show the alumni's support for their juniors as they understand how important it is to have a strong support system as students prepare for the A Levels.  
  
Thank you alumni for having the heart and taking the initiative to serve the College even after you have graduated. A special shout-out to all TMJC alumni/students, do support these alumni initiatives and play your part in one way or another too. Do stay tuned for more updates about their meaningful alumni initiatives!
