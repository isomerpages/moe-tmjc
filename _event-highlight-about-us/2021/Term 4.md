### Cultural Immersion Experience Programme 2021

From 1st to 6th December 2021, the College organised the inaugural Cultural Immersion Experience Programme, a hybrid edition, with our partners from Bhumi Collective. This immersion experience enabled our students to play the role of cultural researchers commissioned to produce a speculative plan about what they imagine the future culture of Singapore in the 22nd Century will look like.  
  
Throughout the 5-day research expedition, students were exposed to local and international cultural practitioners through conversations during both virtual and hybrid workshops. Some highlights of the Programme were the Virtual International Peer-to-Peer Exchange with ArtsEd (Penang) where students shared about cultural preservation through board games, the playtest of the prototype games through Tabletopia on Steam and Discord, and also the Live-Virtual Terinai Dance Workshop by ASK Dance Company (Malaysia).  
  
The Programme culminated in a presentation of the students' Cultural Manifestos which they were free to present through various means. There was a poem, a rap performance, and a TikTok video amongst others.  
  
We hope that this experience has enhanced our students’ knowledge, enthusiasm, and appreciation of cultural heritage in Singapore and South-East Asia.

### College Planning and Farewell 2021

With the last ‘A’ Level paper for our students done in the morning, 3 Dec saw the TMJC staff family coming together as one to end the school year.  
  
The day first began with a working lunch in respective departments, where our Principal, Ms Yoong brought staff through the key messages from the MOE Workplan Seminar 2021 virtually, and staff then discussed in small groups regarding how to build care, capabilities and confidence within the education fraternity. Staff were then brought through reviews and recommendations for 2022 for the various College’s strategic thrusts.

The second half of the programme saw the whole College coming together, albeit in zones, to recognise staff for the various awards: MOE Long Service Awards & Promotions, TMJC & MOE Service Excellence Awards, Cool Moves, Outstanding Staff Contribution Awards, and the MOE ‘Our Schools, Our Stories’ contest. A heartwarming initiative by a group of current students and our alumni, non-teaching staff was also specially appreciated through boards of handwritten notes & a video tribute for their hard work behind the scenes. In addition, we bade farewell to colleagues who will be moving forward to new chapters of their journeys, but will be dearly missed. Last but not least, the day ended with our TMJC family traditions - ROs gifting tokens of appreciation to reportees on behalf of the College, and everyone was given gerberas to pass to one whom they would like to appreciate for the year. This year, our Staff Welfare Committee also prepared food gifts for staff to bring home to our loved ones, to thank them for supporting us for the year.
