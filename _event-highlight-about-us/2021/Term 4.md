### Cultural Immersion Experience Programme 2021

From 1st to 6th December 2021, the College organised the inaugural Cultural Immersion Experience Programme, a hybrid edition, with our partners from Bhumi Collective. This immersion experience enabled our students to play the role of cultural researchers commissioned to produce a speculative plan about what they imagine the future culture of Singapore in the 22nd Century will look like.  
  
Throughout the 5-day research expedition, students were exposed to local and international cultural practitioners through conversations during both virtual and hybrid workshops. Some highlights of the Programme were the Virtual International Peer-to-Peer Exchange with ArtsEd (Penang) where students shared about cultural preservation through board games, the playtest of the prototype games through Tabletopia on Steam and Discord, and also the Live-Virtual Terinai Dance Workshop by ASK Dance Company (Malaysia).  
  
The Programme culminated in a presentation of the students' Cultural Manifestos which they were free to present through various means. There was a poem, a rap performance, and a TikTok video amongst others.  
  
We hope that this experience has enhanced our students’ knowledge, enthusiasm, and appreciation of cultural heritage in Singapore and South-East Asia.

### College Planning and Farewell 2021

With the last ‘A’ Level paper for our students done in the morning, 3 Dec saw the TMJC staff family coming together as one to end the school year.  
  
The day first began with a working lunch in respective departments, where our Principal, Ms Yoong brought staff through the key messages from the MOE Workplan Seminar 2021 virtually, and staff then discussed in small groups regarding how to build care, capabilities and confidence within the education fraternity. Staff were then brought through reviews and recommendations for 2022 for the various College’s strategic thrusts.

The second half of the programme saw the whole College coming together, albeit in zones, to recognise staff for the various awards: MOE Long Service Awards &amp; Promotions, TMJC &amp; MOE Service Excellence Awards, Cool Moves, Outstanding Staff Contribution Awards, and the MOE ‘Our Schools, Our Stories’ contest. A heartwarming initiative by a group of current students and our alumni, non-teaching staff was also specially appreciated through boards of handwritten notes &amp; a video tribute for their hard work behind the scenes. In addition, we bade farewell to colleagues who will be moving forward to new chapters of their journeys, but will be dearly missed. Last but not least, the day ended with our TMJC family traditions - ROs gifting tokens of appreciation to reportees on behalf of the College, and everyone was given gerberas to pass to one whom they would like to appreciate for the year. This year, our Staff Welfare Committee also prepared food gifts for staff to bring home to our loved ones, to thank them for supporting us for the year.

It has indeed been a year that we worked hard ‘to be better together’. The College sincerely wishes all staff a well-deserved break!&nbsp;  
  
  

### 2021 S. Rajaratnam Lecture @ National University of Singapore’ Cultural Centre

  
On 30 November 2021, some of our Citizenship Education Ambassadors had the opportunity to hear Deputy Prime Minister Mr. Heng Swee Keat speak at the 12th&nbsp;S. Rajaratnam Lecture. It was organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) for distinguished public figures to speak on topics related to diplomacy and international relations. At this biennial conference held at the National University of Singapore’s Cultural Centre, they learnt about the role Singapore can play amid current US-China tensions by continuing to strengthen a rules-based multilateral system so that all countries, regardless of size, will have their voices heard and sovereignty respected. The College would like to thank the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for extending this learning opportunity to enrich our students!

### 2021 Final JC1 CT Time

As we close the 2021 academic year, the College would like to encourage our students to reflect on their end-of-year milestones by practising gratitude, reflecting on their personal growth, and planning forward for their holiday and the year ahead during their final JC1 CT Time.  
  
Students participated in the ‘Gratitude Challenge’ by folding and writing ‘thank you’ notes to one person who has made an impact on them during this academic year.  
  
The College would also like to take this opportunity to wish all our JC1 students a restful holiday, to recharge their spirits and energy, and be rejuvenated for 2022!

### Deepavali Celebration@TMJC

This year, Deepavali Celebration began early at TMJC as the Tamil Language students put up beautiful decorations around the College in the last week of October to usher in the festival on the 4th of November, 2021. The Mother Tongue Language Department and the Character and Citizenship Character Committee arranged a short presentation on the 26th&nbsp;of&nbsp; October where Andrea from 21A201 and Srishivani from 21S303 shared an interesting presentation on Deepavali traditions and celebrations. This sparked off a festive mood in the midst of Project Work and A-Level Examinations preparations. The presentation encapsulated the essence of the celebration with engaging videos that explored ‘why’ and ‘how’ the festival is celebrated in Singapore. To commemorate the celebration in our College, a beautiful Rangoli was also designed by the Makers’ Club and adorned the floors of the General Office. The intricate and colourful sticker design added cheer to the College. To round off the celebration, a gathering was arranged for Indian students hosted by the Culture Promotion Club on the 19th&nbsp;of November. During the event, students were treated to a sumptuous lunch treat celebrating Deepavali and the end of examinations. It was a good bonding opportunity with much love, light and laughter.

### TMJC Purple Week 2021

Last week, from 11 to 15 October, our TMJC Staff went&nbsp;_Purple_&nbsp;to show our support for The Purple Parade. The Purple Parade is Singapore’s largest movement to Support Inclusion and Celebrate Abilities of persons with disabilities and 2021 marks the 9th year of The Purple Parade!  
  
At TMJC, we recognise and embrace individuals with different abilities in the pursuit of their passion and interests. We support inclusion and hope to inspire our students to do so too.  
On Wednesday, the staff was also treated to an icy cold treat to beat the October heat. Try to spot this icy treat in the collage!&nbsp;  <br>

### JC2 Award Ceremony and Farewell Assembly

On 15 October 2021, we officially&nbsp;bid&nbsp;farewell to our students from the Class of 2021. The day started off with the Award Ceremony in recognition of our students' achievement in both academic and non-academic areas. Due to safe management measures, the certificates were presented at separate venues and broadcasted live to their peers who cheered for them in the classrooms.

The next segment involved a&nbsp;virtual&nbsp;Farewell Assembly with videos of well wishes and farewell messages put together by both staff, JC1 students and alumni to encourage the graduating cohort to strive for their best at the A-Levels. Students were able to enjoy the camaraderie with their classmates and&nbsp;Civics Tutors&nbsp;in the classrooms.

Mementos which included a Farewell Booklet and a limited edition TMJC caricature key chains were also specially prepared for the cohort. On top of that, Student Leaders also received a charging cable kit in appreciation of their service and contribution.

We are glad to have made it through the past two years together with the JC2 students, particularly in facing the uncertainties and challenges of Covid-19, and we are proud that our students have emerged stronger and have become more resilient.  
  
Indeed, as our College Anthem goes,  
_“With courage and resilience, with honour we’ll succeed…”  
_The A-Level&nbsp;examinations&nbsp;are only a few weeks away.&nbsp; We hope that our students will do their utmost, give their best and finish this&nbsp;journey&nbsp;well.Wishing our JC2 students&nbsp;all the best in their A-Levels!  
  
  

### JC1 Higher Education and Careers Fest
  
In this year’s TMJC JC1 Higher Education &amp; Career Fest, on 8 October, we are very fortunate to have speakers from a range of vocations to share on their work experiences and their passion in their vocation. Some of these speakers are members of the Rotary Club of Raffles City, an organisation consisting of business, professional and community leaders who are dedicated to providing service to others and advancing world understanding, goodwill and peace. We also have speakers who are part of our alumni and speakers who are industry professionals from various fields. The students took this opportunity to ask questions and engage with the speakers as they got a taste of what it is like to work in various industries.  
  
We hope that through this event, the students are able to better understand the current trends in the job landscape, especially as the local economy adjusts to the new normal, as well as the future challenges they will face in navigating the complex world of work. Equipped with this knowledge, we hope that the students are able to make informed decisions about their future higher education and career decisions as they progress beyond their A-Levels.

### JC1 SG Perspectives - Ministry of Foreign Affairs Virtual Engagement Session

On 7 October, JC1 students had the unique opportunity to engage Singapore’s Non-Resident Ambassador to the African Union and Ethiopia, His Excellency Mr A Selverajah. The Ambassador’s virtual engagement session was part of the ‘SG Perspectives’ Programme&nbsp;which seeks to&nbsp;broaden students’ perspectives of Singapore’s foreign policy and how it affects them.  
  
Through Ambassador Selverajah’s sharing, students were sensitised to the key principles of Singapore’s foreign policy and her persistent vulnerabilities as a small country. Students also learnt about how foreign policy impacts their lives. Finally, they engaged him in dialogue on contemporary issues that impact Singapore—such as the recently-passed Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, US-China tensions and the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.  
  
The College would like to thank Ambassador A Selverajah for this most enriching session. The College would also like to thank the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education (Character &amp; Citizenship Education Branch) for co-organising this dialogue for the benefit of our students.

### National Youth Achievement Award (Gold)
The National Youth Achievement Award is one of the premier youth development programmes in Singapore which aims to develop personal qualities of self-reliance, perseverance and a sense of responsibility to self, to society and to the nation. To achieve the Gold Award, students have to fulfil a series of requirements in different areas such as Community Leadership Initiative.  
  
We are pleased to share that four of our JC2 students have attained the National Youth Achievement Award (Gold) this year. They are:

* REN YUN TING, 20S101

* CHERYL TAN WEI XUAN, 20S201

* HO EN YI, 20S302

* DERICK TAY WEI XIAN, 20S412  
  
All four students have taken the initiative to step up and fulfil all requirements despite the challenges that Covid-19 posed. Whilst one student advocated environmental sustainability, the remaining three students organised a virtual learning journey to bring children to various attractions around Singapore as part of the requirement.  
  
Congratulations to all awardees! We are proud of your achievement!
