<h4>International Friendship Day &amp; Beyond</h4>
<p>From 15 – 19 April, TMJC commemorated International Friendship Day to
imbue in students an appreciation for diversity and how Singapore navigates
such diversity on the global stage through her foreign policy. The theme
was ‘Singapore in Asia’ and the commemoration focused on deepening students’
understanding of the friendships nurtured in the ASEAN region, one of the
world’s fastest-growing regions.</p>
<p>In collaboration with the Student Development Team and Culture Promotion
Club, our international students presented on the unique sights, enduring
proverbs and economic potential of Southeast Asia. To increase their cross-cultural
sensitivity via hands-on learning, students also shared on the importance
to foster people-to-people ties to promote the spirit of cross-cultural
friendship and collaboration. Finally, they concretised their understanding
of Singapore’s foreign policy and relations with ASEAN via creation of
a jigsaw mural inspired by the craft activities of the Culture Promotion
Club.</p>
<p>Students will extend their learning on the importance of international
friendships in an increasingly fractious world via the upcoming JC1 SG
Perspectives Student Dialogue Session and Explore! 2024 Overseas Cultural
Immersion Programme in November.</p>
