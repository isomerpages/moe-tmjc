#### TM Unites 2023 - Recycle Right for a Greener Future

After 3 years of hiatus, TM Unites - our cohort VIA, finally took flight on 25 March 2023. The JC1 and JC2 cohorts reached out to the residents of Pasir Ris and Tampines Central respectively to educate and promote good recycling and water conservation habits. The students also worked alongside the Pasir Ris and Tampines Central Town Council cleaners to perform a clean-up of the estates to gain a greater appreciation for the cleaners and develop a stronger sense of responsibility in ensuring the cleanliness of public spaces. Through TM Unites 2023, we hope to do our part as a College to support Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan to build a sustainable, resource-efficient, and climate-resilient nation. At the same time, we also hope to inspire all TMJC students to be young stewards of the environment.

#### National School Games Athletes Oath-Taking Ceremony 2023

To mark the beginning of the National School Games (NSG), the respective Sports Captains and Vice Captains representing our College recited the Athlete’s Oath in the presence of all staff and students at the combined cohort assembly on Friday, 24 March 2023. Our Principal, Mr Sin Kim Ho also delivered a snippet of the Minister’s speech as well as shared his own hopes for the games. Mr Sin also commemorated the ceremony by unveiling our NSG banner to the entire school cohort.

This Oath-taking Ceremony is significant as it advocates the importance of demonstrating sportsmanship through the athlete’s words and actions, both off and on the playing field. Its symbolism aims to unite all with the principles of integrity, fair play and friendship established through sports. 

Each athlete has come a long way and prepared well amidst ongoing challenges. May our College athletes develop tenacity and grit in the pursuit of excellence and embody the values of winning with humility and losing with graciousness in the upcoming competitions. Let us wish our athletes the very best as they compete in the National School Games.
