<h3>Staff Bonding Day</h3>
<p>Our staff teambuilding day at the National Gallery was a perfect blend
of culture, connection, and creativity. Set against a stunning backdrop
of art and architecture, staff took part in an engaging gallery game that
sparked teamwork, laughter, and meaningful conversations. From solving
clues to completing quirky missions, the activity brought energy and joy
to all.
<br>
<br>The morning wrapped up with a sumptuous buffet lunch, where colleagues
bonded over delicious food and hearty conversations. It was a time to unwind,
connect, and celebrate the vibrant spirit of our staff community.
<br>
<br>We left recharged, reconnected, and ready to take on Semester 2 together!

<h3>Brown Bag Session Summary: Navigating Complex Conversations</h3>
<p>At this week‚Äôs Current Affairs Brown Bag Session, students came together
for a lively and thoughtful discussion on some of today‚Äôs most pressing
societal questions. These sessions aimed not to reach firm conclusions,
but to spark dialogue, uncover diverse perspectives, and build a habit
of critical engagement.
<br>
<br>Each session kicked off with a <em>scribble board</em> ‚Äî a new initiative
designed to involve members of the school community who couldn‚Äôt attend
in person. This board invited anyone to pen down their views beforehand,
allowing student facilitators to surface a wider range of voices during
the discussion itself.
<br>
<br>The question of <em>National Service</em> generated plenty of debate, with
students weighing in on whether the male-only policy still aligns with
Singapore‚Äôs emphasis on equality. While views differed, the conversation
showed an increasing willingness to question long-standing norms.
<br>
<br>On <em>whether art should reflect reality or challenge norms</em>, responses
were mixed but engaging. Students touched on ideas of personal expression,
social critique, and the artist‚Äôs responsibility ‚Äî all considered through
cultural, ethical, and even political lenses.
<br>
<br>The final topic, <em>schools and social media</em>, saw students wrestle
with questions of freedom versus protection. While some supported more
regulation for student well-being, others advocated for trust and education
around responsible digital use.
<br>
<br>Across all discussions, there was a clear and deliberate effort to approach
the issues from multiple disciplinary angles ‚Äî whether historical, ethical,
sociopolitical, or cultural ‚Äî to build a more holistic understanding.</p>
<p>Teacher panellists joined in selectively, providing useful insights without
overshadowing student voices. Overall, the session underscored the value
of open, reflective dialogue ‚Äî not for quick answers, but to better navigate
the complex world we live in.</p>

<h3>International Friendship Day &amp; Beyond</h3>
<p>In April, TMJC commemorated International Friendship Day to imbue in students
an appreciation for diversity and how Singapore navigates diversity on
the global stage through her foreign policy. The theme was ‚ÄòForging Friendships
in a Complex World‚Äô. The commemoration focussed on deepening students‚Äô
understanding of Singapore‚Äôs friendships amid global uncertainty ‚Äì in the
ASEAN, one of the world‚Äôs fastest-growing regions.
<br>
<br>In collaboration with Culture Promotion Club and the Student Development
Team, our international students presented the unique sights, enduring
proverbs and economic potential of Southeast Asia. To increase their cross-cultural
sensitivity via hands-on learning, students also shared on the importance
of fostering people-to-people ties to promote the spirit of cross-cultural
friendship and collaboration. Finally, they concretised their understanding
of Singapore‚Äôs foreign policy and relations with ASEAN via roleplaying
to immerse in how cultural diplomacy works, in commemoration of SG60 and
60 years of bilateral relations between Singapore and Malaysia.
<br>
<br>To extend their learning on the importance of international friendships
in an increasingly fractious world, selected students had the opportunity
to hear Prime Minister Lawrence Wong speak at the 14 S Rajaratnam Lecture.
The upcoming JC1 SG Perspectives Student Dialogue Session and Explore!
2025 Overseas Cultural Immersion Programme in November will further enhance
the students‚Äô exposure and learning experiences.</p>
