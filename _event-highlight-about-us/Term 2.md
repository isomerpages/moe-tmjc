<h3>Combined IP Department Learning Journey</h3>
<p>On 8 May, students embarked on an exciting day of exploration with five
multidisciplinary learning journeys to organisations like the Government
Investment Corporation (GIC), vibrant walking tours of Telok Ayer and Boon
Keng, Enabling Village, and ComCrop.
<br>
<br>The dynamic visit to GIC gave students a real-world glimpse into economic
concepts, sparking critical thinking on Singapore’s reserves management
and the power of informed financial decisions. The "Harmony in Diversity"
walking tour brought Telok Ayer’s fascinating cultural history to life,
while the walking tour at Boon Keng revealed how the past and present converge
to shape Singapore’s unique identity. At Enabling Village, students discovered
innovative inclusive spaces and learnt how businesses thrive by embracing
diversity and employing people with disabilities. Finally, at ComCrop,
they explored Singapore’s food security challenges, understanding the nation's
dependence on imports and the vital role of urban farming in ensuring sustainability.
<br>
<br>These immersive and thought-provoking journeys offered TMJCians a deep,
engaging learning experience that encouraged reflection and sparked curiosity.
Well done, TMJCians!

<h3>Brown Bag Session Summary: Navigating Complex Conversations</h3>
<p>At this week’s Current Affairs Brown Bag Session, students came together
for a lively and thoughtful discussion on some of today’s most pressing
societal questions. These sessions aimed not to reach firm conclusions,
but to spark dialogue, uncover diverse perspectives, and build a habit
of critical engagement.
<br>
<br>Each session kicked off with a <em>scribble board</em> — a new initiative
designed to involve members of the school community who couldn’t attend
in person. This board invited anyone to pen down their views beforehand,
allowing student facilitators to surface a wider range of voices during
the discussion itself.
<br>
<br>The question of <em>National Service</em> generated plenty of debate, with
students weighing in on whether the male-only policy still aligns with
Singapore’s emphasis on equality. While views differed, the conversation
showed an increasing willingness to question long-standing norms.
<br>
<br>On <em>whether art should reflect reality or challenge norms</em>, responses
were mixed but engaging. Students touched on ideas of personal expression,
social critique, and the artist’s responsibility — all considered through
cultural, ethical, and even political lenses.
<br>
<br>The final topic, <em>schools and social media</em>, saw students wrestle
with questions of freedom versus protection. While some supported more
regulation for student well-being, others advocated for trust and education
around responsible digital use.
<br>
<br>Across all discussions, there was a clear and deliberate effort to approach
the issues from multiple disciplinary angles — whether historical, ethical,
sociopolitical, or cultural — to build a more holistic understanding.</p>
<p>Teacher panellists joined in selectively, providing useful insights without
overshadowing student voices. Overall, the session underscored the value
of open, reflective dialogue — not for quick answers, but to better navigate
the complex world we live in.</p>

<h3>International Friendship Day &amp; Beyond</h3>
<p>In April, TMJC commemorated International Friendship Day to imbue in students
an appreciation for diversity and how Singapore navigates diversity on
the global stage through her foreign policy. The theme was ‘Forging Friendships
in a Complex World’. The commemoration focussed on deepening students’
understanding of Singapore’s friendships amid global uncertainty – in the
ASEAN, one of the world’s fastest-growing regions.
<br>
<br>In collaboration with Culture Promotion Club and the Student Development
Team, our international students presented the unique sights, enduring
proverbs and economic potential of Southeast Asia. To increase their cross-cultural
sensitivity via hands-on learning, students also shared on the importance
of fostering people-to-people ties to promote the spirit of cross-cultural
friendship and collaboration. Finally, they concretised their understanding
of Singapore’s foreign policy and relations with ASEAN via roleplaying
to immerse in how cultural diplomacy works, in commemoration of SG60 and
60 years of bilateral relations between Singapore and Malaysia.
<br>
<br>To extend their learning on the importance of international friendships
in an increasingly fractious world, selected students had the opportunity
to hear Prime Minister Lawrence Wong speak at the 14 S Rajaratnam Lecture.
The upcoming JC1 SG Perspectives Student Dialogue Session and Explore!
2025 Overseas Cultural Immersion Programme in November will further enhance
the students’ exposure and learning experiences.</p>

<h3>Hari Raya Celebrations</h3>
<p>On 9 April 2025, Tampines Meridian Junior College came alive with the
spirit of Hari Raya Aidilfitri in a vibrant morning celebration that brought
students and staff together in joyful cultural appreciation.
<br>
<br>Held in the college hall, the programme began with a meaningful sharing
on the significance of Hari Raya, offering insights into its religious
and cultural importance. This was followed by an engaging presentation
on how Hari Raya is celebrated across different countries and regions,
highlighting the beautiful diversity within the Muslim world.
<br>
<br>The audience was then treated to a series of lively performances, including
traditional dance and a humorous yet heartwarming skit that depicted festive
customs and family bonds. Adding to the festive cheer were interactive
segments and quizzes that tested students' knowledge and encouraged participation.
<br>
<br>The celebrations continued at the Multi-Purpose Hall with hands-on sessions
where students had the opportunity to make ondeh-ondeh, a beloved traditional
Malay delicacy. Food stations were also set up, offering a wide array of
traditional Hari Raya treats for everyone to enjoy, creating a warm and
communal atmosphere.
<br>
<br>This celebration not only deepened cultural understanding but also reinforced
the college's commitment to inclusivity, mutual respect, and the celebration
of Singapore's multicultural identity.</p>

<h3>Economics Edventure &amp; Project Work Innovation Week 2025 (1 April to 11 April)</h3>
<p>This year’s theme, “Imagining Possibilities”, encouraged students to explore
new ideas, anticipate challenges, and craft innovative solutions through
a variety of engaging activities. Jointly organized by the Economics Department
and the Project Work Committee (PWC), the events aimed to develop critical
and creative thinking while deepening students’ understanding of real-world
issues.
<br>
<br>Key activities included a <strong>Food Security &amp; Sustainability Exhibition</strong>,

using infographics and interactive quizzes. Economic concepts such as resource
allocation and sustainable growth were brought to life through these displays.
<br>

and saving skills, linking personal finance to government fiscal strategies.
This led into the <strong>Budget Choice Competition</strong>, where students
creatively presented and evaluated Budget 2025 initiatives using infographics
or videos.
<br>
<br>The <strong>H2 Budget Enrichment Lecture</strong>, led by JC1 H2 Economics
Representatives, featured skits, videos, and quizzes to demystify Budget
2025. Meanwhile, H1 students explored infographics and joined a Budget
Quiz to build their understanding in a fun, interactive way.
<br>
<br>The PWC also welcomed <strong>Changi Airport Group</strong>, who posed
“How might we” challenges on enhancing customer service amid manpower shortages,
sparking critical and innovative thinking.
<br>
<br>In a session by the <strong>National Library Board</strong>, students learned
research strategies, including the use of precise search terms and Generative
AI tools to strengthen information literacy.
<br>
<br>A highlight was the <strong>SkyeQuest innovation competition</strong>,
where students pitched creative solutions to real-world issues. Finalists’
videos were screened, followed by an interactive Q&amp;A with the audience
and live voting session. The week concluded with JC2 students sharing insights
from their Project Work to inspire their JC1 peers.
<br>
<br>Together, these activities embodied the spirit of exploration, collaboration,
and innovation central to the theme.</p>
