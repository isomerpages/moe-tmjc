For example, the InfiniTuM Student Committee planned and hosted Math Station Games and our very own version of Around the World Monopoly Board Game during students’ break time at the Multi-purpose Hall.

#### Mother Tongue Fortnight 2023 - Embracing our Ethnicity, Exploring Possibilites

The Mother Tongue Fortnight 2023 is centered around the theme “Embracing our Ethnicity, Exploring Possibilities”, with the objective to create an immersive environment for learning and appreciation of Mother Tongue languages and cultures.

On 13 April, our Principal, Mr Sin launched the fortnight of events, with a series of 3 mini-performances: Malay Kompang, Chinese Wushu and Indian Dance. The fortnight’s programme was also presented in the three Mother Tongue languages. 

An array of common enrichment activities were carried out by the three language units to ignite the students’ interest in Mother Tongue languages. This included the broadcast of popular songs  in the different languages before morning assemblies, online QR code quizzes on language and culture, and students’ presentation of cultural topics during lessons. Through “Quote of the Day”, our student presenters also shared a Chinese, Malay or Tamil proverb with their insights during morning assembly, to motivate their peers in their learning.

At the individual unit level, the Malay unit organised the Translation Competition for the H2 MLL students to sharpen their language skills. H2 MLL students were also facilitators for the JC1 H1 Malay Cultural Trail on Malay gastronomy such as herbs and spices, cuisines and traditional desserts.

The Tamil unit organised a guided visit to the Umar Pulavar Tamil Language Centre for our Tamil students who were introduced to the use of herbs in traditional Ayurvedic medicine and Indian traditional music instruments. During the Tamil Enrichment Day on 21 April, the JC1 students participated in an Indian Short Film-Making Workshop to learn to create short videos centered around our school values.

Heritage, music and movies were the main highlights of the Chinese unit’s enrichment activities. In the learning journey titled “Rejuvenation of our Heritage”, H1 Chinese students went on a walking trail to various heritage sites and businesses in Telok Ayer historical district. The Chinese Soundbites was held at the Multi-Purpose Hall during lunchtime on two afternoons with presentation and broadcast of Chinese popular songs to the lunchtime audience. On Chinese Enrichment Day, which was the highlight, the renowned local movie director Royston Tan shared with our JC1 Chinese students meaningful local short films. 

All participating students of the fortnight were gifted a highlighter with a proverb in the respective Mother Tongue languages that encapsulated the essence of the Mother Tongue Fortnight 2023: “Embracing our Ethnicity, Cherish our Culture, Exploring Possibilites”.

#### TMJC Hari Raya Celebrations

The College held a two-part programme in celebration of the joyous occasion of Hari Raya Adilfiltri. The first part was an assembly programme held on the mornings of 19 and 20 April 2023. The opening segment focussed on the different etymology of phrases and wishes related to Hari Raya. The student emcees explained the significance of key phrases such as ‘Eid al-Fitr’, ‘Eid Mubarak’, Hari Raya Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Puasa. 

The programme continued with an impressive Dikir Barat by our own Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) students. This synchronised Malay choral singing was fully choreographed by the students, with the help of their teacher mentors to showcase a glimpse of our college’s MLEP niche programme that focusses on the beautiful Malay heritage and culture. It incorporated singing, poetry, movement and music in a single performance.

The second part of the celebration was held between 25 April and 2 May 2023, where the College provided Hari Raya cookie platters for students during one of their CCE lessons. Civic tutors share the meaning of some traditional Malay kuehs such as Kueh *Bangkit* (The cookie that rises), Kueh *Batang Buruk* (The ugly branch cookie) and Kueh *Tart Sepit* (Pinched Pineapple Tarts). The aim of this activity was to promote cohesiveness and class bonding through the communal sharing, and to raise cultural awareness of the festive celebration activities. The students enjoyed the fun sharing and delightful cookies with their friends. 

The College would like to take this opportunity to wish all Muslims, Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri!

They were also enriched by the sharing held at Tong Heng Traditional Confectionary, and have a better understanding of how the company has rebranded and rejuvenated the business, while preserving the rich heritage of Cantonese pastries.
