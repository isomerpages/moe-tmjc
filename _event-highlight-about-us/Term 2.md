On 28 April, the College celebrated the efforts and achievements of the Class of 2022. The guests, awardees, parents and staff came together to enjoy the beautiful music and movements presented by the TMJC Chinese Orchestra, Modern Dance, and Choir, and witnessed the presentation of awards to distinguished students.

At the ceremony, our Principal Mr Sin Kim Ho commended the Class of 2022 for their resilience and creativity in adapting to learning amidst Covid restrictions, how they kept the College spirit burning strong and even left the legacy of TM Cove, a popular common student space, for future generations of TMJCians to enjoy.

#### TMJC Hari Raya Celebrations

The College held a two-part programme in celebration of the joyous occasion of Hari Raya Adilfiltri. The first part was an assembly programme held on the mornings of 19 and 20 April 2023. The opening segment focussed on the different etymology of phrases and wishes related to Hari Raya. The student emcees explained the significance of key phrases such as ‘Eid al-Fitr’, ‘Eid Mubarak’, Hari Raya Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Puasa. 

The programme continued with an impressive Dikir Barat by our own Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) students. This synchronised Malay choral singing was fully choreographed by the students, with the help of their teacher mentors to showcase a glimpse of our college’s MLEP niche programme that focusses on the beautiful Malay heritage and culture. It incorporated singing, poetry, movement and music in a single performance.

The second part of the celebration was held between 25 April and 2 May 2023, where the College provided Hari Raya cookie platters for students during one of their CCE lessons. Civic tutors share the meaning of some traditional Malay kuehs such as Kueh *Bangkit* (The cookie that rises), Kueh *Batang Buruk* (The ugly branch cookie) and Kueh *Tart Sepit* (Pinched Pineapple Tarts). The aim of this activity was to promote cohesiveness and class bonding through the communal sharing, and to raise cultural awareness of the festive celebration activities. The students enjoyed the fun sharing and delightful cookies with their friends. 

The College would like to take this opportunity to wish all Muslims, Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri!

#### Student Council Camp

On 14 and 15 April 2023, the 5th Tampines Meridian Student Council (TMSC) held the Student Council Camp that would initiate the 6th batch of TMSC.

The 5th TMSC strove to unite the juniors, shared their rewarding experiences and inspired transformational leadership. Leadership training workshops, physical activities and College cheers were conducted to strengthen the camaraderie in each House and equip the 6th TMSC with the leadership knowledge and skills to serve the College. A dialogue session with our Senior Minister, Mr Teo Chee Hean further inspired our student leaders to serve our community wholeheartedly.

To mark the start of the TMSC leadership journey, the iconic Student Council Initiation Ceremony was held, where a flame was passed from the Council Teacher Advisors to our alumni representatives of the 3rd and 4th TMSC, then to the 5th TMSC and finally to our newly initiated 6th TMSC. This tradition is significant as it signifies the symbolic passing of the passion and responsibilities of student councillors through the generations of TMSC. The flame is also a representation of a guiding light, one that will steer our TMSC towards the path of excellence and duty, as they serve the College with fervour and commitment.

#### Mother Tongue Fortnight: Rejuvenation of our Heritage Learning Journey to the Telok Ayer Historic District

The Chinese Language teachers brought 7 subject groups of about 120 H1 Chinese students on a walking trail to various cultural and heritage sites, buildings and businesses from Telok Ayer Street to South Bridge Road. Students explored Thian Hock Keng Temple and the wall murals depicting the history of our Chinese pioneers. They also visited historical sites like the old Chung Hwa Free Clinic and Chong Wen Ge (Chong Hock Girls School), which have now been transformed to an exotic restaurant and museum. At Pek Sin Choo Tea Company, our students learnt how to appreciate traditional Chinese tea and the art of roasting and packaging tea leaves, and also how the business has kept up with modern times. They were also enriched by the sharing held at Tong Heng Traditional Confectionary, and have a better understanding of how the company has rebranded and rejuvenated the business, while preserving the rich heritage of Cantonese pastries. With the knowledge acquired, our students also completed a class quiz on the culture and heritage of Telok Ayer.

#### TM Unites 2023 - Recycle Right for a Greener Future

After 3 years of hiatus, TM Unites - our cohort VIA, finally took flight on 25 March 2023. The JC1 and JC2 cohorts reached out to the residents of Pasir Ris and Tampines Central respectively to educate and promote good recycling and water conservation habits. The students also worked alongside the Pasir Ris and Tampines Central Town Council cleaners to perform a clean-up of the estates to gain a greater appreciation for the cleaners and develop a stronger sense of responsibility in ensuring the cleanliness of public spaces. Through TM Unites 2023, we hope to do our part as a College to support Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan to build a sustainable, resource-efficient, and climate-resilient nation. At the same time, we also hope to inspire all TMJC students to be young stewards of the environment.

#### National School Games Athletes Oath-Taking Ceremony 2023

To mark the beginning of the National School Games (NSG), the respective Sports Captains and Vice Captains representing our College recited the Athlete’s Oath in the presence of all staff and students at the combined cohort assembly on Friday, 24 March 2023. Our Principal, Mr Sin Kim Ho also delivered a snippet of the Minister’s speech as well as shared his own hopes for the games. Mr Sin also commemorated the ceremony by unveiling our NSG banner to the entire school cohort.

This Oath-taking Ceremony is significant as it advocates the importance of demonstrating sportsmanship through the athlete’s words and actions, both off and on the playing field. Its symbolism aims to unite all with the principles of integrity, fair play and friendship established through sports. 

Each athlete has come a long way and prepared well amidst ongoing challenges. May our College athletes develop tenacity and grit in the pursuit of excellence and embody the values of winning with humility and losing with graciousness in the upcoming competitions. Let us wish our athletes the very best as they compete in the National School Games.
