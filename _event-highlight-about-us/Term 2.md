<p>The MTL Department organized the Mother Tongue Fortnight 2024 for our
students, with the objectives to create an immersive environment for the
learning and appreciation of the mother tongue languages and cultures.

with their insights to motivate their peers in their learning.
<br>
<br>The Malay unit organized the Silat Workshop for our Malay students. As

were inculcated. The students also have fun participating actively in the
Congkak Challenge and have a deeper understanding of Malay culture associated
with heritage games.
<br>
<br>The H1 and H2 Tamil students participated in a guided visit to the Indian
Heritage Centre focusing on the interesting traditions of Tamil Culture.
During the Tamil Enrichment Day, the H2 TLL and H1 TL students participated
in a Workshop to learn how to create avatars with artificial intelligence
tools, to make the learning of Tamil language more interactive and engaging.
<br>
<br>For the Chinese Enrichment Day, the renowned local movie director Royston
Tan was invited to share with our Chinese students about his film works,
and how he worked with the elements of food and memories in them. Local

Each student who attended the talk-cum-performance received a box of Ang
Ku Kueh at the end of the event. In the learning journey entitled ‚ÄúRejuvenation
of our Heritage'', the H1 Chinese students went on a walking trail of various
cultural and heritage sites from Telok Ayer Street to South Bridge Road.
They were also enriched by the sharing held at the 90 year old Tong Heng
Confectionery and have a better understanding of how they rebrand and rejuvenate
their business, while preserving the rich heritage of their traditional
Cantonese pastries.

language to encourage them to embrace their mother tongue language and
culture with joy. Have Fun, Speak the Language and Embrace our Ethnicity.</p>

<h4>Student Council Camp</h4>
<p>The 6th Tampines Meridian Student Council (TMSC) held the Student Council
Camp to initiate the newly minted 7th TMSC on 19 and 20 April 2024, with
both JC1 and JC2 Student Councillors buzzing with excitement and anticipation.
Leadership training workshops, physical activities, external games at Pasir
Ris Park and College cheers were conducted to strengthen the camaraderie
within the Houses and equip the 7th TMSC with the leadership knowledge
and skills to serve the College. Among the cherished memories was the creation
of a vibrant TMSC mural, symbols of unity and creativity.
<br>
<br>The highlight of the Camp was the iconic Student Council Initiation Ceremony,
where a flame was passed from our School Leaders to our Council Teacher
Advisors, then to our alumni representatives of the first five batches
of TMSC seniors, then to the 6th TMSC and finally to our newly initiated
7th TMSC. The alumni representatives proceeded to share inspiring tales
of their own leadership and growth.This tradition is of great significance
as it signifies the symbolic passing of the passion and responsibilities
of being a student councillor through the generations of TMSC. The flame
was also a representation of a guiding light, one that will steer our TMSC
towards the path of excellence and duty, as they serve the College with
fervour and commitment.
<br>
<br>The Student Council Camp left our hearts full and spirits uplifted. The
echoes of laughter and the warmth of newfound connections lingered, promising
a treasured legacy of leadership and camaraderie during their term in office.</p>

<h4>International Friendship Day &amp; Beyond</h4>
<p>From 15 ‚Äì 19 April, TMJC commemorated International Friendship Day to
imbue in students an appreciation for diversity and how Singapore navigates
such diversity on the global stage through her foreign policy. The theme
was ‚ÄòSingapore in Asia‚Äô and the commemoration focused on deepening students‚Äô
understanding of the friendships nurtured in the ASEAN region, one of the
world‚Äôs fastest-growing regions.</p>
<p>In collaboration with the Student Development Team and Culture Promotion
Club, our international students presented on the unique sights, enduring
proverbs and economic potential of Southeast Asia. To increase their cross-cultural
sensitivity via hands-on learning, students also shared on the importance
to foster people-to-people ties to promote the spirit of cross-cultural
friendship and collaboration. Finally, they concretised their understanding
of Singapore‚Äôs foreign policy and relations with ASEAN via creation of
a jigsaw mural inspired by the craft activities of the Culture Promotion

friendships in an increasingly fractious world via the upcoming JC1 SG
