<h3><br>Hari Raya Celebrations</h3>
<p>On 9 April 2025, Tampines Meridian Junior College came alive with the
spirit of Hari Raya Aidilfitri in a vibrant morning celebration that brought
students and staff together in joyful cultural appreciation.
<br>
<br>Held in the college hall, the programme began with a meaningful sharing
on the significance of Hari Raya, offering insights into its religious
and cultural importance. This was followed by an engaging presentation
on how Hari Raya is celebrated across different countries and regions,
highlighting the beautiful diversity within the Muslim world.
<br>
<br>The audience was then treated to a series of lively performances, including
traditional dance and a humorous yet heartwarming skit that depicted festive
customs and family bonds. Adding to the festive cheer were interactive
segments and quizzes that tested students' knowledge and encouraged participation.
<br>
<br>The celebrations continued at the Multi-Purpose Hall with hands-on sessions
where students had the opportunity to make ondeh-ondeh, a beloved traditional
Malay delicacy. Food stations were also set up, offering a wide array of
traditional Hari Raya treats for everyone to enjoy, creating a warm and
communal atmosphere.
<br>
<br>This celebration not only deepened cultural understanding but also reinforced
the college's commitment to inclusivity, mutual respect, and the celebration
of Singapore's multicultural identity.</p>

<h3>Economics Edventure &amp; Project Work Innovation Week 2025 (1 April to 11 April)</h3>
<p>This year’s theme, “Imagining Possibilities”, encouraged students to explore
new ideas, anticipate challenges, and craft innovative solutions through
a variety of engaging activities. Jointly organized by the Economics Department

and creative thinking while deepening students’ understanding of real-world
issues.
<br>
<br>Key activities included a <strong>Food Security &amp; Sustainability Exhibition</strong>,
where JC1 and JC2 students explored Singapore’s food resilience strategies
using infographics and interactive quizzes. Economic concepts such as resource
allocation and sustainable growth were brought to life through these displays.
<br>
<br>A <strong>Financial Literacy Talk</strong> equipped students with budgeting
and saving skills, linking personal finance to government fiscal strategies.
This led into the <strong>Budget Choice Competition</strong>, where students
creatively presented and evaluated Budget 2025 initiatives using infographics
or videos.
<br>
<br>The <strong>H2 Budget Enrichment Lecture</strong>, led by JC1 H2 Economics
Representatives, featured skits, videos, and quizzes to demystify Budget

<br>
<br>The PWC also welcomed <strong>Changi Airport Group</strong>, who posed
“How might we” challenges on enhancing customer service amid manpower shortages,
sparking critical and innovative thinking.
<br>
<br>In a session by the <strong>National Library Board</strong>, students learned
research strategies, including the use of precise search terms and Generative
AI tools to strengthen information literacy.
<br>
<br>A highlight was the <strong>SkyeQuest innovation competition</strong>,
where students pitched creative solutions to real-world issues. Finalists’
videos were screened, followed by an interactive Q&amp;A with the audience
and live voting session. The week concluded with JC2 students sharing insights
from their Project Work to inspire their JC1 peers.
<br>
<br>Together, these activities embodied the spirit of exploration, collaboration,
and innovation central to the theme.</p>
