<p><strong>Economics Edventure &amp; Project Work Innovation Week 2025 (1 April to 11 April)</strong>
<br>
<br>This year’s theme, “Imagining Possibilities”, encouraged students to explore
new ideas, anticipate challenges, and craft innovative solutions through
a variety of engaging activities. Jointly organized by the Economics Department
and the Project Work Committee (PWC), the events aimed to develop critical
and creative thinking while deepening students’ understanding of real-world
issues.</p>
<p>Key activities included a <strong>Food Security &amp; Sustainability Exhibition</strong>,
where JC1 and JC2 students explored Singapore’s food resilience strategies
using infographics and interactive quizzes. Economic concepts such as resource
allocation and sustainable growth were brought to life through these displays.</p>
<p>A <strong>Financial Literacy Talk</strong> equipped students with budgeting
and saving skills, linking personal finance to government fiscal strategies.
This led into the <strong>Budget Choice Competition</strong>, where students
creatively presented and evaluated Budget 2025 initiatives using infographics
or videos.</p>
<p>The <strong>H2 Budget Enrichment Lecture</strong>, led by JC1 H2 Economics
Representatives, featured skits, videos, and quizzes to demystify Budget
2025. Meanwhile, H1 students explored infographics and joined a Budget
Quiz to build their understanding in a fun, interactive way.</p>
<p>The PWC also welcomed <strong>Changi Airport Group</strong>, who posed
“How might we” challenges on enhancing customer service amid manpower shortages,
sparking critical and innovative thinking.</p>
<p>In a session by the <strong>National Library Board</strong>, students learned
research strategies, including the use of precise search terms and Generative
AI tools to strengthen information literacy.</p>
<p>A highlight was the <strong>SkyeQuest innovation competition</strong>,
where students pitched creative solutions to real-world issues. Finalists’
videos were screened, followed by an interactive Q&amp;A with the audience
and live voting session. The week concluded with JC2 students sharing insights
from their Project Work to inspire their JC1 peers.</p>
<p>Together, these activities embodied the spirit of exploration, collaboration,
and innovation central to the theme.</p>
