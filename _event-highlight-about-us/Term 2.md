<h4>GP Day 2024</h4>
<p>On 23 May 2024, we celebrated Staff Teambuilding Day with a fantastic
start to the day with our staff promotion ceremony! It was a joyous occasion
recognising the hard work and dedication of our colleagues, setting a positive
tone for the rest of the day. Following the ceremony, we formed groups
and headed to the iconic Changi Airport Jewel for an exciting array of
teambuilding games.
<br>
<br>Our staff had a blast as we navigated through Jewel, solving clues that
not only tested our teamwork but also revealed many interesting and valuable
facts about this stunning landmark. From the spectacular Rain Vortex to
the lush Shiseido Forest Valley, each clue brought new discoveries and
a deeper appreciation of the many facets of Jewel.
<br>
<br>The activities fostered camaraderie and collaboration, strengthening the
bonds within the team. It was a perfect blend of fun and learning, showcasing
the spirit of teamwork and collective effort.
<br>
<br>The day culminated in a sumptuous lunch, a well-deserved treat to celebrate
the ‘heart work’ and effort of our staff throughout Semester 1. It was
a wonderful opportunity to relax, reflect, and recharge for the months
ahead.

<h4>GP Day 2024</h4>
<p>GP Day 2024, held on 17 May 2024, marked the culmination of a series of
engaging fringe activities meticulously organised by the GP department
in the run-up to the event. These activities were designed to set the stage
for an immersive and enlightening experience, providing students with the
opportunity to engage in critical conversations and experiential learning.</p>
<p>Leading up to the event, JC1 students took part in the "Word on the Street"
student journalism competition, where they created insightful 2-minute

captivating learning journeys were offered to students. These included
the exciting Taylor Swift Art Tour at the National Gallery, curated by
our very own GP teacher Ms Michelle Choy; an enlightening visit to the
Internal Security Department Heritage Centre to explore Singapore's history
and the role of ISD; and an educational trip to Werms Inc, where students
learned about composting and even brought home their own composting pack
with live earthworms.</p>
<p>The highlight of GP Day was the GP Unconference in collaboration with
The Birthday Collective, themed 'Critical Conversations: Changemakers'.
Students participated in the Opening and Closing Sessions and joined different
Breakout Rooms that considered various Singapore issues. This year's edition
incorporated thought-provoking experiential activities to stimulate discussions,
fostering an environment for meaningful dialogue and exploration of diverse
perspectives.</p>

<h4>Economics Edventure Series for J2 - Learning Journey to Singapore Maritime Gallery and Port Operations Control Centre!</h4>
<p>On 23 May 2024, a group of our J2 Economics students embarked on an eye-opening
expedition to the Singapore Maritime Gallery and Port Operations Control
Centre (POCC). This immersive experience offered invaluable insights into
the heartbeat of Singapore's maritime industry.
<br>
<br><strong>Singapore Maritime Gallery Tour:</strong>
<br>Our budding economists saw the extensive network of shipping routes that
connect Singapore to the rest of the world. They noted how this connectivity
is crucial for the country's role in international trade. Furthermore,
they explored how Singapore has become a thriving global hub and international
maritime center, understanding its significant implications for international
trade and the economy. They also recognised how strategic geographic positioning
and advanced infrastructure contribute to this status. Additionally, they
learned about the cutting-edge technologies propelling Singapore to world-class
status while ensuring environmental sustainability. Observations included
innovative solutions like automated port operations and eco-friendly practices
that reduce the environmental impact of shipping.
<br>
<br><strong>POCC Visit:</strong>
<br>Our budding economists observed the intense, real-time operations in the
control room, witnessing firsthand how over 1000 vessel movements are managed
daily. They were impressed by the coordination and precision required to
maintain such high efficiency. They gained a deeper understanding of how
POCC serves as the nerve center of Singapore's maritime operations, ensuring
smooth and safe navigation through one of the busiest ports in the world.
Additionally, they noted the use of advanced tracking and communication
systems to monitor and direct maritime traffic. By observing the professionals
at work, our economists appreciated the blend of human expertise and technological
support essential for effective maritime management.
<br>
<br>This experience enriched our students' knowledge of international trade,
globalization, and the intricacies of economics at play. A huge thank you
to our guides and hosts for making this an unforgettable learning journey!</p>

<h4>Inaugural TMJC Homecoming</h4>
<p>On 17 May, we organised the very first TMJC Homecoming event. An alumni-for-alumni
initiative, this was the culmination of the efforts of a dedicated group
TMJC alumni, led by the TMJC Alumni Exco, after many months of planning.
The event sought to reconnect not only the first five graduated batches
of TMJC students, but also the alumni from our parent colleges, TPJC and
MJC. Almost 220 former students and staff, together with our distinguished
guest Mr Amrin Amin, who is an alumnus of TPJC, gathered at our college
campus for a night filled with good food, awesome performances and most
importantly, great fellowship in the most memorable of evenings.&nbsp;

<h4>Sonrisa</h4>
<p>On 10 May 2024, our performing arts CCA groups - Chinese Orchestra, Choir,
Guitar Ensemble, Modern Dance and Symphonic Band, successfully performed
at Sonrisa, a combined performing arts concert. Meaning ‘smile’ in Spanish,
Sonrisa was a student-led endeavour under the guidance of their instructors
and teachers, aimed at celebrating the power of music and dance to bring
people together.
<br>
<br>It was an evening lined up with classical pieces to contemporary tunes,
and a celebration of our students’ passion for the arts and willingness
to perform to the best of their abilities. Throughout the evening, parents
eagerly captured their children's performances on their smartphones, adding
to the warmth of the atmosphere. As the concert drew to a close, the audience
witnessed a heartwarming display of College spirit as our performers spontaneously
led the crowd in our College cheers.</p>
<p>The concert ended on a high note and its success would not have been possible
without the support of the Media Resource Club for the excellent AV and
lighting support, the Photography Club for capturing precious memories
on camera, and the TMSC for being a reliable and efficient backstage crew
for our performers.
<br>
<br>The performers undeniably spread joy and brought smiles to all in attendance.
Sonrisa not only highlighted the transformative power of music and dance
but also created enduring memories, emphasising the ability of the arts
to unite people in shared experiences.</p>

<h4>International Friendship Day &amp; Beyond</h4>
<p>From 15 – 19 April, TMJC commemorated International Friendship Day to
imbue in students an appreciation for diversity and how Singapore navigates
such diversity on the global stage through her foreign policy. The theme

understanding of the friendships nurtured in the ASEAN region, one of the
world’s fastest-growing regions.</p>
<p>In collaboration with the Student Development Team and Culture Promotion
Club, our international students presented on the unique sights, enduring
proverbs and economic potential of Southeast Asia. To increase their cross-cultural
sensitivity via hands-on learning, students also shared on the importance
to foster people-to-people ties to promote the spirit of cross-cultural
friendship and collaboration. Finally, they concretised their understanding
of Singapore’s foreign policy and relations with ASEAN via creation of
a jigsaw mural inspired by the craft activities of the Culture Promotion
Club.</p>

friendships in an increasingly fractious world via the upcoming JC1 SG
