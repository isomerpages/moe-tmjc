<h3>TMJC Deepavali Celebration 2025</h3>
<p>The college dive into the electrifying spirit of Deepavali as our students
brought the joyous spirit of Festival of Lights to life! The celebration
was dominated by the pulsating rhythms and vibrant colours of Bollywood,
with students delivering show-stopping dance performances that got everyone
moving. Their incredible energy and dazzling moves truly embodied the festival's
lively essence.
<br>
<br>This dynamic atmosphere was set against the backdrop of a legendary tale
about the defeat of the invincible demon Narakasura, who could only be
killed by his own mother.&nbsp; The twist? &nbsp; The hero wasn't Lord
Krishna, but his wife Satyabhama, who leapt into battle and delivered the
final blow—revealing herself to be the demon's own mother in a past life!&nbsp;
The drama perfectly blending the festival's message of hope and empowerment
with an unforgettable, high-energy experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>JC1 Higher Education and Careers Fest 2025</h3>
<p>On 14 Oct 2025, our students took part in a valuable higher education
and career exploration day.
<br>
<br>It kicked off with an informative SkillsFuture Advice Workshop, where
they learnt about industry trends, emerging skills, and useful resources
for their future. A key feature of the day was the vibrant Higher Education
and Careers Fair, where students, along with many parents and JC2 students,
had the opportunity to engage with industry representatives and explore
various pathways. The day wrapped up with insightful Professional Sharing
Sessions, giving students a more concrete understanding of potential education
and career options, and a concurrent Parent Engagement Session with university
representatives, where parents gained valuable insights into upcoming programmes,
admission considerations beyond grades, and ways to support their child’s
educational journey.
<br>
<br>We’re hopeful that this experience has provided our students with useful
information and motivation as they consider their future paths, and has
given parents valuable insights to better support their children’s educational
and career decisions. It was encouraging to see students’ active participation
and engagement throughout the day’s activities, as well as parents’ involvement
and enthusiasm during the parent engagement session.</p>

<h3>JC2 Awards Ceremony and Farewell Assembly 2025</h3>
<p>On 10 October 2025, we came together to celebrate and bid farewell to
the Class of 2025. The day began with the unveiling of the <em>Stairway to Excellence</em> Mural,
a creative collaboration by the graduating cohort. The mural, displayed
on the spiral staircase, symbolises their pursuit of excellence and the
lasting legacy they leave behind as they take their next steps beyond TMJC.
<br>
<br>The celebration continued with the Awards Ceremony, where students were
recognised for their dedication and achievements in the co-curricular domains.
The hall was filled with energy and pride as classmates cheered one another
on, reflecting the strong bonds and spirit that define our TMJC family.
<br>
<br>The Farewell Assembly followed, beginning with an inspiring address by
Mr Sin, who shared his encouragement and advice for the road ahead. Juniors
then expressed their gratitude to their seniors for their warmth and guidance,
while teachers conveyed heartfelt messages through touching videos and
vibrant live performances. The event concluded with College Anthem and
the resounding College ‘O’ cheers and <em>Satu Nada, </em>led by our TMSC
and beloved mascot, Skye.
<br>
<br>Each JC2 student received a TMJC Skye plushie keychain as a keepsake to
commemorate their journey, while the Student Leaders were presented with
a specially designed Skye fan in appreciation of their service and leadership.
<br>
<br>We are proud of every student from the Class of 2025. May you carry forward
the TM spirit of excellence, courage, and compassion in all that you do.
