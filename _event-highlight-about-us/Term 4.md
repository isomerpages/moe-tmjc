<h3>JC2 Awards Ceremony and Farewell Assembly 2024</h3>
<p>On 11 October 2024, we bade farewell to our students from the Class of
2024. The day started with the unveiling of the Stairway to Excellence
Mural, where students from the graduating cohort designed a beautiful mural
for the staircase risers of the first flight of steps of the spiral staircase.
The mural represents not just the cohort’s achievements, but also their
commitment to excellence as they embark on their journey beyond TMJC.</p>
<p>The next segment was the Awards Ceremony, where the cohort celebrated
the achievements of their peers in both academic and co-curricular areas.
It was a joyous occasion where all JC2 students gathered in the hall to
cheer on their friends who were recognised for their contributions and
accomplishments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third highlight of the day was the Farewell Assembly programme. It
commenced with Mr Sin’s opening address where he shared his well-wishes
and gave valuable advice to the cohort. The juniors then shared their deepest
appreciation to their seniors for their guidance and support in welcoming
them to their respective CCA groups. Loud cheers rang through the hall
when it was the teachers’ turn to deliver their heartfelt messages for
the JC2 students through captivating, sentimental videos and mesmerising
live choreographed performances. The event ended on a high with the College
Anthem, College 'O' cheer and College ‘Satu Nada’ cheer with our well-loved
College mascot, Skye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each student was given our beloved TMJC Skye plushie as a meaningful memento
to remember their TMJC experience. Student Leaders also received a specially
crafted Skye mug in appreciation of their service and contribution to our
College.</p>
<p>From the bottom of our hearts, we wish the graduating cohort all the best
for their A-Levels and their future endeavours. TM Boleh!</p>

<h3>SG Perspectives (Staff) with Permanent Secretary Mr Aubeck Kam</h3>
<p>On 11 October, our teachers had the unique privilege of engaging Permanent
Secretary (Home Affairs Development, and Social and Family Development)
Mr Aubeck Kam in dialogue as part of the SG Perspectives Programme which
seeks to broaden perspectives on contemporary issues that impact Singapore.
Permanent Secretary Kam spoke on the challenges and importance of “Securing
the Future of Homeland Security in Singapore.” The staff gained an insight
into the crucial role that they can play in educating students on issues
of national concern such as online youth self-radicalisation and the increase
in young drug offenders. The College would like to thank PS Kam for the
enriching session. The College would also like to thank the Ministry of
Education Character &amp; Citizenship Education Branch for co-organising
this dialogue for the benefit of our teachers.</p>

<h3>TMJC Higher Education and Careers Fest 2024</h3>
<p>On 9 Oct 2024, our students took part in a valuable higher education and
career exploration day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It kicked off with an informative SkillsFuture Advice workshop, where
they learnt about industry trends, emerging skills, and useful resources
to help them make informed decisions about their future career. The highlight
was the bustling higher education and careers fair, where students, along
with many parents, had the opportunity to engage with industry representatives
and explore different exciting pathways. The day wrapped up with insightful
sharing sessions by industry professionals, giving students a more concrete
understanding of the different careers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're hopeful that this experience has provided our students with useful
information and motivation as they consider their future paths. It was
encouraging to see their active participation and interest throughout the
day's activities.</p>

<h3>Student Leaders’ Congress</h3>
<p>On 8 October, the Student Leadership Committee held our annual Student
Leaders’ Congress. The theme for this year was "Empowering Youth of Tomorrow".
Student leaders gathered together to learn from real world thought leaders
through a series of learning journeys and workshops, and engaged in meaningful
discussions to identify possible catalysts of positive change. They also
had the opportunity to exchange perspectives and insights with students
from Denmark who were visiting the College as part of a homestay experience,
thereby enriching their discussions. The student leaders ended the session
feeling inspired to embrace challenges, innovate and take actionable steps
towards creating a positive impact in the community and shaping a brighter
future for the community and nation.</p>

<h3>Explore! Copenhagen 2024 Exchange</h3>
<p>From 4 to 8 October, participants of the upcoming Explore! Copenhagen
2024 trip had the pleasure of hosting students from Rysensteen Gymnasium,
Denmark. Our students provided their Danish counterparts a first-hand experience
of life in Singapore through a weekend homestay experience.</p>
<p>On 7 October, as part of their trip’s anthropological focus, the Danish
students and their local buddies participated in the Faithful Footprints
Interfaith Heritage Learning Journey conducted by Humanity Matters to learn
about Singapore’s rich multicultural heritage. The programme aimed to help
participants understand Singapore's unique model of multiculturalism through
experiential journeys to religious sites in the Bencoolen area where participants
learnt stories of the contributions and collaborations of pioneer migrant
and faith communities. Our Danish friends’ immersion into the Singaporean
way of life culminated in their participation in the Student Leaders’ Congress
organised by the College’s Student Leadership Committee. Danish students
and TM student leaders broadened their perspectives through dialoguing
and learning about the shared challenges of nation-building. A wonderful
time of cross-cultural interaction and learning was had by all!</p>
