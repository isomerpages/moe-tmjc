<h3>SG Perspectives (Staff) with Permanent Secretary Mr Aubeck Kam</h3>
<p>On 11 October, our teachers had the unique privilege of engaging Permanent
Secretary (Home Affairs Development, and Social and Family Development)
Mr Aubeck Kam in dialogue as part of the SG Perspectives Programme which
seeks to broaden perspectives on contemporary issues that impact Singapore.
Permanent Secretary Kam spoke on the challenges and importance of “Securing
the Future of Homeland Security in Singapore.” The staff gained an insight
into the crucial role that they can play in educating students on issues
of national concern such as online youth self-radicalisation and the increase
in young drug offenders. The College would like to thank PS Kam for the
enriching session. The College would also like to thank the Ministry of
Education Character &amp; Citizenship Education Branch for co-organising
this dialogue for the benefit of our teachers.</p>

<h3>Student Leaders’ Congress</h3>
<p>On 8 October, the Student Leadership Committee held our annual Student
Leaders’ Congress. The theme for this year was "Empowering Youth of Tomorrow".
Student leaders gathered together to learn from real world thought leaders
through a series of learning journeys and workshops, and engaged in meaningful
discussions to identify possible catalysts of positive change. They also
had the opportunity to exchange perspectives and insights with students
from Denmark who were visiting the College as part of a homestay experience,
thereby enriching their discussions. The student leaders ended the session
feeling inspired to embrace challenges, innovate and take actionable steps
towards creating a positive impact in the community and shaping a brighter
future for the community and nation.</p>
