#### Teachers’ Day 2023 

All aboard Flight TM2023! In line with our theme, ‘Teachers Change the World’, TMJC celebrated the kindness, generosity and hardwork of our teachers by bringing them on a holiday experience around the world. 

Our School Leaders started the celebrations dressed as flight Captains at Morning Assembly where our Principal, Mr Sin, thanked and encouraged our teachers in continuing to inspire each and every one of us. TMJCians then spent some quality time with their Civics Tutors and Subject Tutors during class-based celebrations where we pampered our teachers with a meaningful collection of short appreciation notes and a bag tag to encourage them to take a little travel break when they can! Games and food were also shared in this personalised part of the celebration, or rather pre-flight refreshments.

The celebrations then culminated in the in-flight entertainment in the hall which was a flight-themed concert that brought us on a journey around the world with performances inspired by the likes of cities like Tokyo, New York and of course, Singapore. Our concert ended with a heartening video collage of memories of our teachers at work to the meaningful song ‘You have made a Difference’ by Brian Asselin. Indeed teachers, 

“You have made a difference
You have shaped our minds
You have changed the world
One child at a time
You have always been there
In everything you do
We hope that you're as proud of us
As we are proud of you”

Happy Teachers’ Day!
