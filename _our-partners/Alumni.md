### Partnering our Alumni

TMJC is indeed blessed with alumni from both of our parent colleges, as well as those who graduated as TMJC alumni from 2019 onwards. Many of whom have come forward to contribute back to their alma-mater in varied manners, be it through helping out with their CCAs, being part of the designing process that make up our College identity, sharing their experiences to encourage their juniors, and even mentoring their juniors as part of the latterâ€™s leadership journey. All in all, the College seeks to continue to tap on the vast experiences and opportunities our alumni possess, so as to value-add towards the holistic development of our students.
