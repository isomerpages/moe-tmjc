The TMJC College Advisory Committee (CAC) comprises seven members. Some had previously served as CAC members in our respective parent colleges, some are alumni from both parent colleges, and some are new members. The CAC provides support for the collegeâ€™s rich variety of programmes for both students and staff. The College is privileged to have members with such extensive experience in industry, education and community relations.
