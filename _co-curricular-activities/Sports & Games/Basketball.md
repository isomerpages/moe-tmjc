Our TMJC Basketball Team is a close-knit family. Our Basketballers forge their close bonds through their commitment and hard work during on-court training and helping each other through the JC journey off the courts. With courage and resilience, our Basketballers always play their hearts out during competitions. Moving forward, our Basketballers have one shared aim and that is to work hard together and help each other to be better than yesterday.
