**One Team, One Goal, One Heart** is the motto of our College's Netball Girls' team.  
The motto reflects the enthusiasm of our dynamic team of young ladies driven by the same goal of striving towards excellence in their sports skills with a passionate heart. Under the guidance of their inspiring coach, Ms Neo Ah Geok, the Netball team has geared up their netball skills and fitness by training hard twice a week and sharpening their court play skills in friendly matches with other junior colleges.  
  
Our members treasure the learning opportunities, not only as sportswomen but also as individuals, in terms of character development. They learn important values such as determination, resilience, teamwork, and effective leadership skills. We pursue the sport for our love of the game.
