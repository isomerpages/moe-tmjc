Our Shuttlers are like family who train hard and play hard together. We support and encourage each other through good times and tough times. Both our Boys' and Girls' teams train hard under the instruction of our coach and developed speed, power, stamina, accuracy and mental strength - elements crucial to being an accomplished badminton player.  
  
Besides gaining exposure through various inter-school competitions, the team also organises the TMJC Badminton Age Group Tournament, that brings together participants from different schools, whenever possible.Â  As we move ahead, we will continue to strive hard to bring TMJC Badminton to greater heights!
