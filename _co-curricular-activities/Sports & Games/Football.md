There is no “I” in “team”, so you never walk alone. Our Footballers are a cut above the rest and have always valued mental resilience, good stamina, and unquestioning dedication within the team. 2019 saw a renewed commitment to these goals, with team talks and regular feedback sessions to motivate the players and reinforce their shared purpose. Training sessions were more intensive, with a greater focus on the improvement of individual skills together with stronger teamwork. The team demonstrated admirable moral and emotional support and clinched 4th place for the Boys' competitions.  
  
The recent years saw new challenges but our Footballers remained steadfast in their quest for excellence as individual players and as a team. This sport will continue to be a place where one’s prowess, grit, and passion are continuously tested and sharpened.
