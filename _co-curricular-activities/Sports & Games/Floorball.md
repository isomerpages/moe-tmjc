Founded in 2019, the TMJC floorball team is a hardworking team that strives to always come out on top and be the best. We take pride in developing athletes with both physical and mental fortitude. Hence, we are able to nurture highly disciplined and proficient floorballers every year. We strive to help every member reach their greatest potential, in floorball as well as character.  
  
Prior floorball experience is not required as our coach, Jatin Nair, who is Singapore Floorball Men’s National team’s coach, is a highly skilled and experienced coach who greatly nurtures not only our floorball skills but also our character growth. Apart from just our regular training sessions, our floorballers look forward to our annual floorball camp and 5v5 tournament.
