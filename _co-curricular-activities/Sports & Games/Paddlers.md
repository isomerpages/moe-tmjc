Long, Hard, Pull. This motto encapsulates the spirit of our paddlers who pull hard in the water and exhibit a never-say-die attitude.  All paddlers are exposed to various rowing activities such as kayaking and dragon boating. Through the weekly dragon boat training sessions at Kallang, the paddlers’ physical prowess and mental endurance are put to the test. With strong determination and teamwork, our paddlers emerged as champions in both 12 crew and 22 crew boys category of the 19th National Inter-schools A Division Dragon Boat Championship. In addition, all paddlers are tasked to obtain 1 Star and 2 Star certifications for kayaking and embark on an annual kayaking expedition to Ubin Island which allows them to forge strong bonds and build lasting memories. These activities allow the paddlers to cultivate useful life skills and a positive mentality which will see them through the 'storms' in life.
