With a heart of resilience, a shared vision and a passion for the outdoors, the TM Outdoor Activities (ODAC) provides a safe space for students to challenge themselves and **learn new skills.** As lovers of adventure, ODAC **explores** outdoor navigation, learns the ropes behind structure making, and acquires skills to start a fire just from twigs and branches alone! On top of that, ODACians are given the opportunity to initiate activities that they would like to venture into, such as kayaking, abseiling, and camping sessions, on top of the already exciting activities! It is perfectly alright if they do not have prior experience, because in ODAC, there is a strong culture of growing and learning together as a family, and rejoicing alongside one another as they mark milestones and achievements of getting certified together.  
  
After all, "Life is a journey, not a destination". – Ralph Waldo Emerson
