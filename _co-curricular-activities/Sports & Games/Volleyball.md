Comprising members who are passionate about playing volleyball, the TMJC Volleyball Team believes in building a high level of camaraderie within the team and striving for continuous improvement.  
  
In addition to the twice-a-week training sessions under the guidance of our teachers and coaches, we initiate additional sessions to improve on teamwork and stamina when the competition draws near. We aspire to build upon the strong foundation set by our seniors to achieve greater heights!
