A good archer is measured not by the accuracy of a single arrow, but by the consistency of all his or her arrows on the target. Similarly, our Archery Team is defined not by the talents of a single archer, but by the collective efforts of the entire team. Despite our archers consisting of mostly first-timers, we always grow to support one another mentally and physically through arduous training sessions and immense competition pressure to compete in external competitions. Our archers also get the opportunity to represent the College in the prestigious NUS Indoor Archery Championships. Together, the team will continue to aim their sights further and higher in the next season.
