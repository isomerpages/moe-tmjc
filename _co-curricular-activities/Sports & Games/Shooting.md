Shooting is a sport that requires concentration, consistency, and confidence. Upper body strength, impeccable hand and eye coordination, balance, and posture are paramount to the shooter. In TMJC Shooting we train twice a week. Shooters take up air rifles or air pistols and focus on getting better and improving their skills.  
  
Shooters get to participate in the NUS Invitational Shoot, NTU Invitational Shoot, and also in the National School Games A division. We also have various collaborations with other CCAs such as ODAC to have joint activities to enrich our CCA experiences.
