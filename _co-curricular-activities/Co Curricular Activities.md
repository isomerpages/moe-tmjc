Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) are a cornerstone for character development and build a spectrum of essential life skills. Through CCAs, students develop skills such as communication, collaboration and teamwork, as well as deepen their sense of belonging and identity to the College, community and nation.  

Tampines Meridian JC provides a wide and diverse variety of CCAs for students to select from.  The CCA teachers work closely with our instructors to plan and conduct enriching and purposeful activities for students to discover their passion or develop their talents. Students take pride in participating in one quality CCA for holistic development in terms of CCA specific knowledge, life skills, competencies and values.
