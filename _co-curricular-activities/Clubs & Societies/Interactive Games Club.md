The Interactive Games Club (IGC) combines fun with learning, with members of the Club engaging in a battle of wits as they strategise and compete against each other in games like Blokus and Saboteur. There are also regular Othello workshops for IGC members conducted by local experts in the field, leading to an opportunity for members to take part in the Singapore Schools Othello Championship.
