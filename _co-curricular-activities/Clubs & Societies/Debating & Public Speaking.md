Our Society, through tenacity and courage, develops students into competent public speakers and debaters. Founded on the values of teamwork, debaters work closely together to overcome opponents with wits and intellect. The ability to converse confidently on contemporary issues and to articulate oneâ€™s opinions are identifiable characteristics of students from Debating & Public Speaking Society.
