As the voice chosen by the student body, the Tampines Meridian Student Council strives to embody our College values and cultivate a vibrant college culture. Student Councilors are passionate individuals with a zest for life which motivates their service to the college.  
  
The Student Council is the main organiser of key College events such as Orientation. It plays a large part in co-organising other College events such as the Student Leaders’ Investiture, Open House, and the JC2 Farewell Assembly. It also organises the cheer support for our college teams during the National School Games A Division Championships and carries out the Feedback and Dialogue sessions of the various cohorts to ensure that student voices are indeed heard. In addition, the Student Council has spearheaded the development of College identity by running the processes that created the College's PE T-shirt, Polo T-shirt, and the designs for our five House Crests.  
  
The Tampines Meridian Student Council comprises of five committees – Community Outreach, Admin and Data, Logistics and Welfare, Publicity, and College Spirit Committee – all of which require different talents and skills so a diverse range of leaders with different leadership experiences and backgrounds are always welcome to run for Council as long as they are willing to learn and serve the College.
