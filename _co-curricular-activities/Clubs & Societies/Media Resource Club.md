In the Media Resource Club, we believe in the spirit of service and excellence. Besides managing the Public Announcement (PA) system during morning assemblies, the Club provides audio and visual support for various important College events such as the Council Investiture and College Day.  
  
The students also provides video coverage for the Performing Arts CCAs for their SYF performances and external concerts. The Club continues to hone its members’ videography skills, branching out into various newer styles of presentations that are trending in current media. The Media Resource Club is a small but tightly knitted club where every member looks after one another’s personal growth, not only in developing technical skills but also in building character and friendships.
