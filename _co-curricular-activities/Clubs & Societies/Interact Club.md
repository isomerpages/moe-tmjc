The Interact Club provides opportunities for people who are passionate about service and who embody the value of “Service above Self” to plan and execute activities to reach out to the community.  
Members will have regular opportunities to volunteer with various beneficiaries such as the elderly, children, and persons with special needs. Members can also advocate for important social issues such as environmentalism and mental wellbeing, inspiring their peers and driving positive change through their actions.  
  
The Club also embarks on some special projects annually. For instance, in 2019, the Club collaborated with Mummy Yummy to distribute free cooked vegetarian food to York Hill residents living in rental flats.
