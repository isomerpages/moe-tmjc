The Culture Promotion Club (CPC) is a close-knit CCA that aims to instill in students a sense of graciousness for other cultures and traditions as well as appreciate and share the rich culture and heritage of our multi-racial society. In CPC, apart from attending cultural workshops conducted by professionals such as basic Malay traditional dance and Chinese calligraphy, our members are also empowered to conduct their own mini\-workshops that further enrich their knowledge of the myriad cultures around the world. These include lantern making, origami, henna painting, and yoga. Indeed, such activities truly uphold our Club’s tagline “Embracing Diversity, Appreciating Cultures”.
