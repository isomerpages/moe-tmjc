The Photography Club prides itself as a community for aspiring student photographers to hone their craft through a series of workshops, competitions, volunteer projects, activities, and trips. Their expertise and skills in photography are also honed through photo-taking for college events, outings, and collaborations with other CCAs.  
  
Our students are given different opportunities to showcase their works through exhibitions to the rest of the College and, at times, use photography as a medium to highlight certain social issues to the public. Our students also develop and acquire relevant skills such as the conceptualisation of ideas, the detailed technical understanding and execution of how to take a good photo, and the printing and exhibition of photos which will enrich their learning even as they deal with unexpected challenges from time to time. Besides photography skills, our students graduate eventually with a set of life skills and a positive attitude that will empower them in the next phase of their life.
