The Tampines Meridian Dance Society is guided by the principles of passion, discipline, and perseverance. Constantly striving to achieve clarity and impact in their movements, the dancers train hard to develop strong techniques in various genres such as contemporary, hip-hop, and waacking, among others.  
  
Our dancers have the opportunity to participate in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation whenever held. Dance items put up show much resilience and strength in their journey to the SYF each time. Beyond the SYF, our dancers also have opportunities to choreograph and present items that were uniquely theirs. Student choreographers work intensively with their peers to put up stunning performances for various school events such as TM Celebrates! and at the Open House. As the dancers continue to develop as better dancers individually and as a team, they look forward to many more performances.
