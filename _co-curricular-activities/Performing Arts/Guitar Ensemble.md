“One Ensemble, One Sound” - This is the motto of the TMJC Guitar Ensemble. Every member is as precious and unique as a gemstone. The Ensemble provides a relaxed environment for all students with a love for music and guitar to learn and play together, with every member having a unique and important role to play. Students of any skill level are encouraged to come and join us. Beginning with a bridging workshop for newcomers, each member’s journey promises ample opportunities to perform, learn and grow.
