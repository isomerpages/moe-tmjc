Every person can make magic on stage - we believe there is a budding actor or actress in every person. We look forward to entertaining friends and families as we continue to explore performing opportunities, including staging an in-house production on College premises at our Performance Lab. Wherever our stage ends up being, whoever our audience may be...there you will find us making magic!
