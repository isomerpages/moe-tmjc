The TMJC Symphonic Band believes in the pursuit of strong musicianship, character, and leadership. With camaraderie in our musical journey, the Band consistently clinches accolades in recognition of their dedication at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). The Band also takes pride in the opportunity to make music on special occasions, College events, as well as in its biennial concerts. The chance to delight and entertain audiences is a privilege for our members, who put their heart and soul into perfecting their music. With the support and encouragement from the college, alumni, parents, and friends, the Band members look forward to scaling greater heights and creating more wonderful memories in the coming years!
