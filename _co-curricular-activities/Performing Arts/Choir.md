Music is like family - filled with highs and lows. With our motto **“As _one_ Voice, We Sing”** we strive to greater heights as a family. Driven by the same passion for choral singing, we have set aside our differences and ensure the inclusivity of each and every member. Under the baton of our conductor, Ms. Angela Lee Sze Ling, and our Teachers-In-Charge, we are closely knitted, and we bring their guidance to fruition into our repertoire. Music is our home, and this is our TMJC Choir family.
