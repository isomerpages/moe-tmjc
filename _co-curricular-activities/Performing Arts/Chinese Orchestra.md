The Chinese Orchestra (TMCO) was formed in 2019. As an orchestra, we participate in community events such as the Lunar New Year celebrations in Pasir Ris West annually where we entertained members of the public in this festive occasion. TMCO also participates in the Bi-Annual Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation. The CO believes that with perseverance, every member can learn his/her instrument within the 2 years of CCA practices.
