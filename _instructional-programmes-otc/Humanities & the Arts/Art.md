The TMJC Department of Art & Aesthetics offers both H1 and H2 Art.

Both H1 and H2 Art students undertake the Study of Visual Arts (SOVA) written component which emphasises the development of visual literacy and art criticism skills by encouraging personal responses to art making and art appreciation. Additionally, H2 students undertake a Studio Practice component.

H1 Art is designed to provide opportunities for students to broaden their engagement in the visual arts. Content and skills acquired through themes and topics of study aim to cultivate in students greater understanding of and sensitivity towards artworks, developing individuals who enjoy, appreciate and foster a lifelong interest in the Visual Arts. Students offering the H1 Level Art syllabus will investigate artistic conventions and concepts through the study of artists and artworks, developing visual literacy skills, such as perception of and response to visual images, as well as critical analysis of visual information.

  

H2 Art, on the other hand, is designed to provide students with an in-depth study in the visual arts. The breadth and depth of study cater for a wide range of interests and abilities. In addition to SOVA, students are also involved in the process of art making (Studio Practice) using a variety of media and technologies, which encourages the development of critical thinking, and the spirit of exploration.

These aptitudes are essential in the face of the challenges of the knowledge-based and innovation-driven economy. In addition to the practical experiences, students will investigate artistic conventions and concepts through the Study of Visual Arts component. Visual literacy skills, such as perceiving and responding to visual images, and analysis of visual information, are further enhanced and developed.
