Chemistry is the study of the structure, properties and transformation of matter at the atomic level. A key feature of the A-Level Chemistry syllabus is the development of the students’ ability to navigate between the macroscopic phenomena, submicroscopic interactions and symbolic representations to attain a deep conceptual understanding of the behaviours of chemical systems. This will enable students to extend their way of thinking about many aspects of daily life such as environmental pollution, food science and pharmacy.  
  
Through the study of Chemistry, TMJC students will be equipped with skills and attitudes necessary for further studies in related fields. The students will develop critical thinking skills to be able to explain scientific phenomena, approach and solve problems in chemical systems.  
  
Practical lessons are designed over two years with the aim to develop scientific inquiry skills. Students will have opportunities to observe phenomena, pose scientific hypotheses, plan and conduct investigations, present and interpret data and make decisions based on scientific fact and principles. Students will learn how to communicate scientific findings and information using appropriate language and terminology, thereby honing their scientific literacy.  
  
TMJC students are also provided with a wide-range of learning experiences in the classroom. Engaging lectures, effective questioning, animations, videos, models and hands-on activities are just some of the few pedagogies implemented to attain content and skills required to solve problems in real-world context. The use of inquiry-based pedagogical approaches, which includes the skilful use of ICT, will engage students in critical thinking, reasoning and argument.  
  
In TMJC, students are provided with opportunities to go beyond the curriculum. An in-house H3 programme is offered to JC2 students with keen interest and flair for Chemistry. At the end of JC1, selected and interested students will be able to compete at the Chemistry Olympiad organised by National University of Singapore. Our teachers provide customised training for the Chemistry Olympiad and other competitions. Other enrichment programmes include:  

* Chemistry related In-house research workshops,  
* Student –initiated learning activities designed by the Chemistry department  
* Australian National Chemistry Quiz  
* Science Research Programme  
* Ad-hoc Workshops / lectures  
* Learning journeys
