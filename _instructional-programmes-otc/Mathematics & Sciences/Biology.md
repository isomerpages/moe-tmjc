Biologists explore the living world at various levels (molecular, cellular, organismal and environmental) using varied methods. Through studying Biology at TMJC, our students are equipped with the awareness of how scientists work, communicate and collaborate with one another worldwide, thus preparing them for future endeavors in Biology-related fields.  
  
Our practical lessons present ample opportunities for our students to design scientific experiments, collect and present scientific data, develop manipulative skills, analyse and evaluate results and communicate their findings - very much working like a scientist.  
  
On top of the emphasis on practical approaches in our curriculum, our classroom pedagogies also take on different forms, such as effective questioning and team-based learning. Our constant use of computer graphics and animations allows our students to visualise molecular and cellular processes that cannot otherwise be witnessed with our naked eyes. We also bring current and pressing real-life issues into our classrooms, such as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, ethical debates on the use of stem cells in research and the causes and impact of climate change on our living world.  
  
We encourage our students to learn beyond the curriculum. Enrichment programmes/activities include:  
  
●     Our in-house research workshop on forensic science  
●     Singapore Biology Olympiad  
●     Nanyang Research Program  
●     Science Research Program  
●     A\*STAR student Attachment Program  
Through these, we hope to bring the learning of Biology beyond the four walls of a traditional classroom setting to help our students understand the nature of scientific knowledge, demonstrate science inquiry skills and relate Biology to the broader society.
