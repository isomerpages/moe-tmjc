TMJC offers Mathematics at H1, H2 and H3 levels to cater to the different needs, interests and abilities of students. H1 Mathematics, as a contrasting subject, provides students with a foundation in mathematics and statistics that will support their Business or Social Science studies at the university. H2 Mathematics prepares students for a range of university courses, such as mathematics, sciences, engineering and computing, where a good foundation in mathematics is required. H3 Mathematics provides students with passion and ability in mathematics an insight into the practice of a mathematician. Students are provided with the opportunity to solve more challenging problems in mathematics and prove mathematical results.  
At TMJC, we nurture every student to realise his/her potential in mathematics. Teachers employ a wide range of pedagogies in classrooms and small group lectures. Approaches include productive failure, assessment for learning, and teaching for understanding. Teachers guide students to construct their own understanding, deepen their conceptual understanding of mathematics and strengthen their metacognitive skills using the constructivist approach. ICT is incorporated in teaching and learning, including a library of videos on graphing calculator steps and Google sites, to enhance the effectiveness of pedagogy. Teachers design learning experiences, including the use of real-world contexts and applications of mathematics, that inculcate the value of resilience and develop a growth mindset. Students develop thinking, reasoning, communication and modelling skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving.  
  
Enrichment activities are organised to bring students outside the confines of traditional classroom learning and to make their learning of mathematics more enjoyable. Through these, students appreciate the value of mathematics in life and develop the joy of learning. These enrichment activities include:  
* Mathematics Awareness Fortnight (MAF)  
* Fastest Fingers Graphing Calculator Competition  
* Singapore Mathematical Olympiad  
* Australian Mathematics Competition  
* Designing with TI Graphing Calculator Competition  
* International Mathematical Modelling Challenge
