In order to provide students with a higher language proficiency and a deep interest in literature and culture the opportunity to pursue the languages at a greater depth and wider breadth, TMJC offers Mother Tongue Language and Literature at H2 level in the three different languages.  
  
Besides honing their language skills, students taking H2 Mother Tongue Language & Literature will learn to appreciate representative works of prose, poetry, novels and drama in both classical and modern contexts. Being aligned to the educational developments, these subjects have a language paper to be done electronically. Each of these H2 MTLL subjects will be examined via 3 papers – Paper 1 which comprises composition, Paper 2 which is an electronic paper comprising language application, and Paper 3 which is on the analysis of literary works. On top of the classroom curriculum, H2 MTLL students will be given opportunities to take part in talks, seminars, competitions and writing programmes. 

In addition, TMJC is one of the five junior colleges in Singapore to offer the Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP).  Students who take H2 MLL will be enrolled in the 2-year Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP) which aims to nurture the interest of academically inclined and linguistically talented students to pursue the Malay language at a higher level. Students in the programme will be exposed to a variety of MOE and school organised enrichment activities in the endeavor to increase their expertise and competency in the Malay language, culture, history and literature.
