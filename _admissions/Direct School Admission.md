## 2022 Direct School Admission Exercise (DSA)


The DSA-JC exercise aims to promote holistic education by giving participating JCs the flexibility in selecting secondary school students for admission to JC1 based on their achievements and talents while upholding key principles of transparency, fairness, and meritocracy. It provides students with the opportunities to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to JCs.
