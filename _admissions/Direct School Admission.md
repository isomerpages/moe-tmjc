# 2023 Direct School Admission Exercise (DSA)

The DSA-JC exercise aims to promote holistic education by giving participating JCs the flexibility in selecting secondary school students for admission to JC1 based on their achievements and talents while upholding key principles of transparency, fairness, and meritocracy. It provides students with the opportunities to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to JCs.&nbsp;

**Be part of the Tampines Meridian Experience!**&nbsp;&nbsp;You could be an exceptional sportsperson who has represented the State or participated in competitions at the national level, or&nbsp;you could be a performer with laudable talent, performance experience, and competition achievements. Come and join us if you treasure enriching learning experiences, look forward to well-rounded college life, and aspire to grow and contribute to the College.
