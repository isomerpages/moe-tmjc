<h1>2025 Direct School Admission Exercise (DSA)</h1>
<p>The DSA-JC exercise aims to promote holistic education by giving participating
JCs the flexibility in selecting secondary school students for admission
to JC1 based on their achievements and talents, while upholding key principles
of transparency, fairness and meritocracy. It provides students with the
opportunities to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents
in seeking admission to JCs.
