<p>With the global landscape becoming increasingly interconnected, it is
important for our students to broaden their learning and experiences to
beyond our borders. Our Collegeâ€™s overseas exposure programme, ExpLORE!,
offers rich opportunities for students to <strong>Exp</strong>erience foreign
cultures,&nbsp;<strong>L</strong>earn about emerging economies in the region,&nbsp;<strong>O</strong>bserve
unique societal issues,&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>econnect with their Singaporean
identity as well as&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>nrich the lives of others by
contributing their services in overseas communities. Through a mix of virtual
exchanges and the resumption of physical overseas learning journeys that
students can look forward to in the post-pandemic era, we aim to grow our
students as individuals and citizens who are equipped to be an active member
of the global community.</p>
