With the global landscape becoming increasingly interconnected, it is important for our students to broaden their learning and experiences to beyond our borders. Our College’s overseas exposure programme, ExpLORE!, offers rich opportunities for students to **Exp**erience foreign cultures, **L**earn about emerging economies in the region, **O**bserve unique societal issues, **R**econnect with their Singaporean identity as well as **E**nrich the lives of others by contributing their services in overseas communities. Through a mix of virtual and physical overseas learning journeys, we aim to grow our students as individuals and citizens who are equipped to be an active member of the global community.
