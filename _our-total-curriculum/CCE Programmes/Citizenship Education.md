Our Citizenship Education Programme seeks to foster a culture of concerned citizenry among students, a 21st CC desired outcome. These are the 3 pillars that undergird the programme:  
First, we endeavour to hone our students’ ability to take perspectives and see the interconnectedness of contemporary issues at the global, national and personal levels. This helps them better understand how they relate to the world around them, effected through contemporary issue-infused CCE lessons and dialogue sessions with foreign dignitaries, thought leaders and policymakers.  
  
Second, we harness an experiential approach when conceptualising activities for national and international commemorative events such as National Day and Earth Day. Multi-sensorial engagement nudges students beyond understanding contemporary issues towards developing a greater sense of conviction to cherish Singapore.  
  
Finally, we adopt a whole school approach. To enhance the impact of Citizenship Education, we weave aspects of Citizenship Education into academic subjects—where meaningful and feasible. For example, the importance of nation-building was integrated into General Paper ‘Arts and Culture’ topic discussions. Students learnt about the significance of UNESCO’s 2020 inscription of Singapore’s Hawker Culture on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.  
  
In TMJC, selected students hold an appointment as Citizenship Education Ambassadors (CEAs) as peer influencers in Citizenship Education matters, aiming to engage their hearts and minds in contemporary issues that impact Singapore.
