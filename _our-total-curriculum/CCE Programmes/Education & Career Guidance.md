Education and Career Guidance (ECG) in TMJC believes in inspiring our students to aspire towards higher academic, career or even personal goals by equipping them with important skills to help them transit into the VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous) world. This will involve an ECG Curriculum which helps the student to address the 3 key ECG questions of “Who am I?”, “Where do I want to go?” and “How do I get there?”. Our ECG Curriculum therefore comprises a wide range of programmes which partner various stakeholders to cater to students with different ECG needs and to guide them in their ECG journey.  
  
Some of these programmes include university talks, career talks by industry professionals, career counselling by our College’s ECG Counsellor, career symposiums and fairs to help them discover their interests and talents, and align them with future education and career options. In addition, students will also immerse in different educational and career experiences which include lessons on career skills (interview skills, resume/CV/personal statement writing, financial literacy etc), as well as internships, learning journeys and industrial attachment opportunities to help them gain exposure to the real work environment.  
  
Through a comprehensive ECG experience, we hope to develop students who are future ready and confident persons, well-equipped to take on the challenges of the future.
