Education and Career Guidance (ECG) in TMJC believes in inspiring our students to aspire towards higher academic, career or even personal goals by equipping them with important skills to help them transit into the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world. This will involve an ECG Curriculum which helps the student to address the 3 key ECG questions of “Who am I?”, “Where do I want to go?” and “How do I get there?”. Our ECG Curriculum therefore comprises a wide range of programmes which partner various stakeholders to cater to students with different ECG needs and to guide them in their ECG journey.  
  
Some of these programmes include university talks, scholarship information sessions, career talks by industry professionals/alumni, career counselling by our College’s ECG Counsellor and career fairs to help them discover their interests and talents, and align them with their future higher education and career options. In addition, students will also immerse in a range of experiences which include CCE lessons on career life skills (interview skills, resume/CV/personal statement writing, financial literacy etc), as well as internships, learning journeys and industrial attachment opportunities to equip them with important life skills and to help them gain exposure to the real work environment.  

Through a comprehensive ECG experience, we hope to develop students who are future ready and confident persons, well-equipped to take on the challenges of the future.
