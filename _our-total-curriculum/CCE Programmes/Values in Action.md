Values in Action Programme
--------------------------

  
Our Values In Action (VIA) programme aims to inculcate values of social responsibility, humility and life-long volunteerism in our students. Through the programme, we hope that our students will develop the heart and will to serve others, touch lives, and make the world a better place.  
  
To provide real contexts and experiences for our students to serve the community, we have adopted the Service Learning Philosophy towards VIA to engage our students by means of interactive activities and community projects both locally and overseas. We believe in a bottom-up, student-led, service-learning programme that focuses on developing long-term partnerships with welfare organisations. Through the process, students not only help improve the lives of others, but also transform their own.  
The students’ VIA experiences are guided by **SPARK framework** in four key aspects. They 
1. are given the opportunity to **S**hare perspectives, 
2.  **P**ut their values into Actions and **A**dvocate for a good cause, 
3. **R**eflect on their VIA experiences, and 
4. plan how they can **K**eep up with  contributing to positive change in the community beyond their journey in TMJC.  
  
We hope that, through these experiences, our students can become socially responsible and engaged citizens who are willing and able to spark positive change in local and global communities.
