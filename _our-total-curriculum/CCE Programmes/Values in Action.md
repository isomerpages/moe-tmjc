Values in Action Programme
--------------------------

  
Our Values In Action (VIA) programme aims to inculcate values of social responsibility, humility and life-long volunteerism in our students. Through the programme, we hope that our students will develop the heart and will to serve others, touch lives, and make the world a better place.  
  
To provide real contexts and experiences for our students to serve the community, we have adopted the Service Learning Philosophy towards VIA to engage our students by means of interactive activities and community projects both locally and overseas. We believe in a bottom-up, student-led, service-learning programme that focuses on developing long-term partnerships with welfare organisations. Through the process, students not only help improve the lives of others, but also transform their own.  
The students’ VIA experiences are guided by **SPARK framework** in four key aspects. They 
1. are given the opportunity to **S**hare perspectives, 
2.  **P**ut their values into Actions and **A**dvocate for a good cause, 
3. **R**eflect on their VIA experiences, and 
4. plan how they can **K**eep up with  contributing to positive change in the community beyond their journey in TMJC.  
  
We hope that, through these experiences, our students can become socially responsible and engaged citizens who are willing and able to spark positive change in local and global communities.

Some of our key signature VIA programme include:  

*   TM Connects, an annual Community Awareness event for students to gain awareness and have a better understanding of different community issues.  
    
*   CG VIA, where each class is given the opportunity to initiate student-led VIA projects based on their areas of interest and the organisation that they would like to serve.  
      
*   TM Sparkles, a College-wide Cleanliness Project which encourages TMJC students to take responsibility for the cleanliness of venues they use frequently.

*   TM EcoGreen, a program that aims to nurture our College as stewards of the environment where we learn and practise environmental sustainability through the 4 Cs: Curriculum, Campus, Culture and Community.
