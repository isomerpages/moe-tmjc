Our College believes that every student has the potential to be an effective leader who is anchored on strong values and equipped with leadership competencies to lead and serve in an ever-changing world. Our Student Leadership Programme is specially designed in a 2-pronged approach to achieve this desired outcome.  
Firstly, we believe in providing real-life experiential learning for students to apply their leadership skills. With that belief, we offer a range of leadership roles for students to step up, including that of Student Councillors, CCA Leaders, Civics Group Leaders, Peer Support Leaders and also various experiential leadership roles such as Orientation Group Leaders, PW Group Leaders, Student-Initiated VIA Group Leaders etc .  
In their capacity as student leaders, they will be empowered to set strategic direction and lead their peers in planning and organising activities at groups, CGs, CCAs, and College levels.  
  
Secondly, our students will be exposed to an expansive and customised Student Leadership Training Programme that is undergirded by the Leadership Challenge Model to help them to work towards demonstrating the 5 practices of exemplary leadership which include: (1) Modelling the Way, (2) Inspiring a Shared Vision, (3) Challenging the Process, (4) Enabling Others to Act, (5) Encouraging the Heart.  
Our student leaders will be given the opportunities to go through a series of workshops and camps, such as Leadership Training Camp, Student Leaders’ Congress as well as the Specialised Training Workshops, to deepen their understanding of leadership. A robust student-teacher mentorship framework is also put in place to guide our student leaders throughout their leadership journey.  
  
Through our holistic Student Leadership Programme, we hope that our student leaders will be positive change-makers to society and be ready for the world beyond the classroom.
