The College believes that every student has the potential to be an effective leader who is anchored on strong values and equipped with leadership competencies to lead and serve in an ever-changing world. Our Student Leadership Programme is specially designed in a 2-pronged approach to achieve this desired outcome.  

Firstly, we believe in providing real-life experiential learning for students to apply their leadership skills. With that belief, we offer a range of leadership roles, such as being Student Councillors, CCA Leaders, Civics Group Leaders, Peer Support Leaders and also various experiential leadership roles such as Orientation Group Leaders, Project Work (PW) Group Leaders and Student-Initiated Values-in-Action (VIA) Group Leaders. In their capacity as student leaders, they will be empowered to set strategic direction and lead their peers in planning and organising activities at small group, Civics Group, Co-curricular Activity, and College levels.
  
Secondly, to support our student leaders in their various leadership roles, they will be exposed to an expansive and customised Student Leadership Training Programme that caters to the unique needs of the different student leadership groups. The Student Leadership Training Programme is undergirded by The Leadership Challenge model to help them work towards demonstrating the 5 practices of exemplary leadership which include: (1) Model the Way, (2) Inspire a Shared Vision, (3) Challenge the Process, (4) Enable Others to Act, (5) Encourage the Heart.  

Our student leaders will be given opportunities to go through a series of workshops and camps, such as the Leadership Training Camp, Student Leadersâ€™ Congress, Leadership Summit as well as Specialised Training Workshops to deepen their understanding of leadership. A robust student-teacher mentorship framework is also put in place to guide our student leaders throughout their leadership journey in TMJC.  
  
Through our holistic Student Leadership Programme, we believe that our student leaders will be positive change-makers to society and be ready for the world beyond the classroom.
