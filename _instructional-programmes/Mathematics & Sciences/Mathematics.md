<p>TMJC offers Mathematics at H1, H2 and H3 levels to cater to the different
needs, interests and abilities of students. H1 Mathematics, as a contrasting
subject, provides students with a foundation in mathematics and statistics
that will support their Business or Social Science studies at the university.
H2 Mathematics prepares students for a range of university courses, such
as mathematics, sciences, engineering and computing, where a good foundation
in mathematics is required. H3 Mathematics provides students with passion
and ability in mathematics an insight into the practice of a mathematician.
Students are provided with the opportunity to solve more challenging problems
in mathematics and prove mathematical results.</p>
<p>At TMJC, we nurture every student to realise his/her potential in mathematics.&nbsp;Teachers
employ a wide range of pedagogies in classrooms and small group lectures.
Approaches include productive failure, assessment for learning, and teaching
for understanding.&nbsp;Teachers guide students to construct their own
understanding, deepen their conceptual understanding of mathematics and
strengthen their metacognitive skills using the constructivist approach.
ICT is incorporated in&nbsp;teaching and learning, including a library
of videos on graphing calculator steps and Google sites, to enhance the
effectiveness of pedagogy.&nbsp;Teachers design learning experiences, including
the use of real-world contexts and applications of mathematics, that inculcate
the value of resilience and develop a growth mindset.&nbsp;Students develop
thinking, reasoning, communication and modelling skills through a mathematical
approach to problem-solving.</p>
<p>Enrichment activities are organised to bring students outside the confines
of traditional classroom learning and to make their learning of mathematics
more enjoyable. Through these, students appreciate the value of mathematics
in life and develop the joy of learning. These enrichment activities include:</p>
