History education in Singapore seeks to develop in students an appreciation of past human experiences, a critical awareness of the nature of historical knowledge, and the ability to make connections between the past and present. The A Level History curriculum seeks to develop conceptual understanding of historical knowledge, to encourage students to gain depth of understanding in historical events and their connections to the present.  Historical agency is also emphasised in the syllabus, allowing students to appreciate the complexities of multiple perspectives and the dynamic interactions between diverse actors in understanding local, regional and global developments.

TMJC's History programme welcomes all students who are keen to engage with multiple perspectives about historical events and issues through readings and discussions, learn to formulate arguments, judiciously select evidence to substantiate them, and weave them together into a cogent piece of prose. The programmes deliver the curriculum through an inquiry-based approach, and taps on relevant technological tools, for example, Padlet, Google apps, and the MOE Student Learning Space to enable students to be comfortable to discuss, share ideas, and in the process hone their analytical and critical thinking skills both in thought and in writing.

In addition, the department encourages students to participate actively in various enrichment opportunities. A key in-house curated series of enrichment activities, Arts and Humanities Week, is organised annually to bring the Humanities subjects alive and enable our students to appreciate and understand the subjectâ€™s relevance to the world around us. Beyond that, students are encouraged to participate in simulated United Nations and ASEAN Conferences, attend lectures by distinguished speakers in various fields, participate in physical and virtual learning journeys to places such as the Singapore Internal Security Department Heritage Centre and National Museum to extend their learning beyond the classroom.
