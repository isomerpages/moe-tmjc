In line with the A Level Geography Curriculum, Geography at TMJC seeks to develop conceptual understanding of geographical knowledge, allowing students to gain depth in understanding stakeholders and processes that shape the physical and human environment they live in.

With an aim to equip students with the ability to analyse, evaluate and reflect on information received, students learn to develop logical arguments and make informed decisions. This allows Geography students to better appreciate the complexities of situations by considering multiple viewpoints and the dynamic interactions between physical and human environments at local, regional and global scales. Ultimately, Geography education at TMJC seeks to develop in students an appreciation of the Earth’s landscapes, peoples, places and environment, putting their understanding of social and physical processes within the context of places and regions, and motivating Geography students to be critical and responsible citizens.

TMJC’s Geography programme adopts an inquiry-based approach whereby students acquire geographical knowledge through lectures and tutorial discussions. Geographical learning is also done via geographical tools such as Google Earth, Geography simulation games, and a series of enrichment activities such as Arts and Humanities Week, designed to deepen and extend their learning.

The Geography unit adopts a hands-on approach through both local and regional field trips. These field trips are adopted to enrich students’ understanding and application of geographical knowledge. This includes hearing from Geographers in the various fields of geographical applications, as well as field trips to apply Geographical Investigation skills and knowledge. Geography students are also given opportunities to lead and participate in Geography-related activities, which allows them to have a hands-on application of knowledge and skills learnt in the classroom. Opportunities are also provided for students to participate in inter-school Geography activities and competitions to engage and apply their Geographical skills and knowledge.
