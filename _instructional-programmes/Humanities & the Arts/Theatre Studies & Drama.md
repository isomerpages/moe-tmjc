<p>The Theatre Studies and Drama (TSD) Elective Programme explores the human
experience through the conceptualisation, construction, and reception of
theatrical events and dramatic texts.</p>
<p>At TMJC TSD, we believe that each student is unique. We aim to embolden
our young student-artists to be critical thinkers about the world around
them through a values-driven education. With the backing of dedicated teachers,
supportive parents, and encouraging peers, we strive to develop a community
of student-artists who give their best to their craft.</p>
<h5>OUR THEATRE STUDIES &amp; DRAMA VALUES</h5>
<p>We believe in building a community of learners who love their craft, take
ownership of their work, and who have the courage to try new and exciting
things. Our TSDians seek truth in their craft and tell stories that they
believe in because they believe in the transformative potential of drama.</p>
<p>Students have the opportunity to develop their skills and confidence in
creative mediums they are passionate about, strengthening their courage
to express themselves freely and to try again despite setbacks.</p>
<h5>OUR LEARNING ENVIRONMENT</h5>
<p>Our learning takes place within our TMJC Performance Lab, in weekly practical
workshops focusing on performative skills, complemented by seminar-style
praxis lessons and discussions.</p>
<p>Performance methods covered in lessons and workshops range from the canonical
practitioners such as Stanislavski, Grotowski, Brecht, Boal, to contemporary
influences like Suzuki, and Viewpoints. Students will also gain knowledge
in a wide range of exciting theatrical traditions (e.g. Commedia Dell’arte,
Dance-Theatre, Butoh) and examine how Art movements (e.g. Russian Constructivism,
Surrealism, Expressionism) interact with theatrical forms. Students are
expected to read vigorously to develop a niche area for their Individual
Skills assessment.</p>
<p>Opportunities for experiential learning and practice will be provided
through the TMJC TSD Masterclass Series, which have included workshops
with theatre companies such as Frantic Assembly (UK), The Finger Players
(SG), Nine Years Theatre (SG) in areas such as vocal work and playwriting.</p>
<p>The Department also organises learning journeys to watch theatrical performances,
and leverages on digital platforms to enable students’ appreciation of
various theatrical processes. Students are encouraged to reflect after
every learning journey to develop analytical thinking, confidence in articulation,
as well as ability to respond critically to creative stimuli.</p>
