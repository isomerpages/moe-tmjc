General Paper (GP) is a compulsory H1 subject for all JC students. GP aims to develop in students the ability to think critically, construct cogent arguments and communicate their ideas using clear, accurate and effective language. While a good command of the English Language is needed to read, understand, respond and write convincingly, GP is more than an English Language paper. Through this subject, students will explore a range of key issues of global and local significance and analyse current affairs and societal trends. Students then formulate informed opinions on the significance and implications of these issues for the individual and society.

There are specific themes covered each term, with thematic resource packages prepared to guide students in their understanding of concepts and issues relevant to the themes. These packages contain articles, case studies and video links to broaden studentsâ€™ content knowledge and guide their critical examination of the issues. Students are also equipped with thinking and writing skills to handle both Paper 1 and Paper 2.

To cultivate a strong interest in current affairs, our teachers prepare current affairs lessons and quizzes to keep students abreast with local and global news. Students are also encouraged to participate in enrichment activities such as the Pre-University Seminar, learning journeys, conferences and seminars that are organised by external organisations to take learning beyond the classroom.

Through collaborative learning, students co-construct meaning from their knowledge and experiences. Classroom activities such as group discussions and class presentations encourage active participation of students. Through collaboration, students also learn to respect different perspectives and value the contributions of their peers.

Written assignments are set on a regular basis, and the Department places a balanced focus on assessment for and of learning. We hope that this would improve student engagement and motivation and bring about greater confidence for students to learn.

We hope GP will help our students find their personal voices to make sense of an increasingly complex world.
