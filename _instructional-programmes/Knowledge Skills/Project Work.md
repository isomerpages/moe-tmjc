<p>In today’s dynamic and fast-changing world, students need to learn how
to engage with issues, and process information that is often unmediated
and not subject-specific. Students also need to learn to work together
on tasks that require a repertoire of skills and to apply what they have
learnt to complete a project in a group. This is the principle on which
Project Work (PW) at the H1 level has been anchored and developed. Hence,
PW provides a learning experience which aims to provide students with the
opportunity to synthesise knowledge from various areas of learning, and
critically and creatively apply them to real-life situations. This process
enhances students’ knowledge and enables them to acquire skills such as
collaboration, communication and independent learning, preparing them for
lifelong learning and future challenges.</p>
<p>Essentially, PW is about investigating and solving real-world problems.
As a subject, it aims to develop in students a set of relevant skills (thinking,
collaborative, creative) through a structured process and in so doing,
equip our students with competencies that are relevant to the world of
work today.</p>
<p>To achieve the learning outcomes of PW and to prepare students for the
future, TMJC adopts Design Thinking as a methodology. Solutions are developed
using a human-centric approach to meet the real needs of the target group(s),
an approach that is becoming increasingly crucial in solving real-world
problems today. Students undergo an introduction to Design Thinking to
equip themselves with the necessary skills. Critical role-play as a pedagogical
approach is also adopted to help elicit the user experience, an essential
aspect in Design Thinking.</p>
<p>Students also get to attend various programmes, such as workshops that
equip students with the necessary soft and hard skills. These include workshops
such as the basics of 3D modelling and the essentials of evaluative writing.
The PW Team Leaders also undergo the PW Team Leader Seminars to raise their
leadership awareness and competencies. The Leadership Challenge Model,
developed by Kouzes and Posner, is adopted and modified to the PW context,
with an added focus on Conflict Resolution. In addition, to support students’
independent learning, Independent Learning Modules (ILMs) may also be introduced
at various junctures of the students’ PW journey.</p>
