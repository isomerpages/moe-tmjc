The Mother Tongue Languages Department of TMJC offers different curricula catered to the needs of different students and aims to realise the full potential of students’ ability in their Mother Tongue languages. Through the academic and enrichment programmes, the Department hopes to nurture active learners and proficient users of their Mother Tongue languages, and at the same time, imbue students the skills to plug into a globalised world while being connected to their Asian heritage and roots.  
  
The majority of our students will do their Mother Tongue Languages at H1 level, which is designed to prepare students to meet local university entry criteria to their best abilities, while recognising the relevance of the languages to their lives. The H1 Mother Tongue Languages place strong emphasis on communicative skills, particularly in the areas of oral, reading and writing. Each of these H1 Mother Tongue Language subjects will be examined via 2 papers –  Paper 1 which comprises composition and comprehension, and Paper 2 which comprises oral and listening comprehension. Students will take their exams in Term 3 and 4 in their first year of study in our College.  
  
A key in-House enrichment programme, the Mother Tongue Languages Fortnight (MTLF) is organised annually, that immerse students culturally in their MT languages.
